A Tinder-like application that helps computer science students discover and save courses by swiping right on classes that match their preferences or left to skip, using a personalized recommendation algorithm powered by comprehensive course data.

MVP Functions:
- Matching: Student views CS classes presented as cards, they can accept to save a class or reject it.
- Matching Algorithm: An algorithm that improves and learns student preferences by analyzing their swiping actions and adapts future course recommendations accordingly.
- Course Labels: Courses are labeled with tags like "Software Development", "Mathy", and "Resume Project" that are used by the matching algorithm to find relevant courses.
