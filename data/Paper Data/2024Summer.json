This results in a continuous need for new products, and for managing all aspects of discovering, designing, developing, supporting and monetizing innovations. In technology companies, the Product Management organization is responsible for the \"inbound\" product development activities as well as \"outbound\" product marketing activities: discovering customer needs, defining product requirements, orchestrating the development of products and solutions to address these needs, taking new products to market, and managing products over their life cycle. In a technology startup, a Product Manager is often a co-founder of the firm. Larger technology firms have specialized Product/Tech organizations consisting of various types of roles, including Product Managers and their core cross-functional teams — Product Marketing Managers, Program Managers/Scrum Masters, Engineers, UX/UI Designers and Content Strategists, and Data Scientists.

The hunt takes many paths: finding love, wealth, or fame; earning an education, job, or lifestyle; attaining bliss, heaven, or a fairy tale ending. This writing class explores how we have defined, pursued and, at times, attained happiness. We ask the question: \"is happiness a goal or a journey?\" We examine how the ideal of happiness finds expression in our culture through philosophy, art, literature, music, and film. We also explore social phenomena such as the quest for higher education, the explosion of the self-help industry, and the ebb and flow of our consumer culture. Writers will read a variety of sources on the pursuit of happiness and conduct their own research to reflect, shape, and argue their perspective. Writers will compose a variety of documents that will ultimately lead to a ten to twelve-page persuasive researched essay. Writers will also learn scholarly conventions that they can apply to other academic course work. The course is conducted completely online. It will be asynchronous; students can participate in discussions and complete assignments by working at their own pace, as long as deadlines are met. A technology fee will be added to tuition.

much of the twentieth century, revolution was often seen as the answer to Latin America's chronic poverty and economic injustice. Yet, despite the fact that revolutionary movements emerged in almost all Latin American countries, very few of these movements came to power. Why did some revolutionary groups triumph, while others failed? Once in power, how successful were revolutionary governments at achieving their goals, and what challenges did these regimes face? This course addresses these questions by examining revolutionary movements in Cold War Latin America. It pays particular attention to three nations in which leftist movements came to power: Cuba, Chile, and Nicaragua, examining the relationship between revolutionary leaders and their nations' citizens, foreign influences on the trajectory of each nations' politics, and the lived experience of revolutionary times. This course focuses as well on developing students' understanding of how historians construct arguments and how to evaluate competing historical interpretations of events.

They dominate the social, political, and economic landscape of our world. Understanding how organizations shape our lives is crucial to gaining some control over the outcomes which affect us. Due to their ubiquity, organizations have been phenomena to which social science has devoted much research. Due to their complexity, definitive explanations of organizational structures, processes, and outcomes have been difficult to achieve. This course provides an overview of what is known about complex organizations. Students are introduced to various theoretical paradigms that explain different aspects of organizational life. They learn how to use theoretical models to analyze organizational problems. Solutions to problems are suggested by the various research studies that provide a knowledge base for this course. By the end of the course, students will be able to diagnose organizational problems and devise targeted remedies. This course is conducted completely online.

Through a focus on ethnography, a fundamental method of our field, students will learn how to conduct research into the processes that shape the social world, emphasizing human agency in relation to sociohistorical, economic, political, and environmental forces. Students will learn about the history of the field of anthropology and scholarly approaches across the discipline today. A key feature will be to denaturalize social assumptions, reinterpreting what we might know from our own contexts as a starting point to understand others.

Can objects have a social life? How does living in the material world impact our social realities? Such questions are among those fueling the work of contemporary archaeologists. In this course, we examine objects and artifacts, to develop a critical perspective on theoretical approaches to material culture. Learning content and activities engage students with key theories and methods in archaeological data collection and analysis. Lectures, readings, podcasts, and films emphasize how archaeology furthers the aims of anthropology, to expand understandings of the human condition. As a subfield within the discipline, anthropological archaeology combines the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, to examine cultures through material objects - over time. Through a local cemetery field trip, students have the opportunity to examine how archaeologists locate, record, and excavate the built environment through monuments and city planning. Students will also witness how artifacts are later organized and studied in the lab on campus. Assignments like weekly written field reports will guide students in developing some of the techniques used by archaeologists to piece together stories about the past and present - supported by material evidence. A range of kinds of objects will be explored throughout the class: from teddy bears, cars, toothbrushes, and body hair, to landscaping, and the shopping mall. Topics span from how archaeologists research migration, long-term climate change, and sustainability, to information and communication technologies like VR, AI, and social media."],["Class Materials (Required)","All required materials will be provided via Canvas."]],"o":"43","f":"3"}]},{"i":"001097","c":"WCAS","t":"The Study of Culture through Language","u":"ANTHRO","n":"215-0","s":[{"i":"001097-1","r":[{"n":"Mahmure Idil Ozkan"}],"t":"The Study of Culture through Language","u":"ANTHRO","n":"215-0","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"l":["ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn"],"d":"2024-06-17","e":"2024-07-28","c":"LEC","a":25,"p":[["Overview of class","Course Description:\nThis course provides an introduction to the field of linguistic anthropology. Drawing from ethnographic studies of culture through language use in different social settings, students will develop an understanding of how language shapes and reflects social structures, identity, and communication practices in societies. Through theoretical readings, case studies, documentaries, and practical exercises, we will analyze linguistic practices as lenses through which to investigate aspects of identity formation as well as power relations among groups in societies. We will address issues such as language standardization, language as symbolic power, linguistic nationalism and minority languages, multilingualism, language learning and socialization, \"accents,\" and more. These topics will provide grounds for understanding:\n-\tWhat is language, how it shapes the way we think and vice versa,\n-\tHow different linguistic varieties are understood to index social differences including speakers' social class, ethnicity/race, and gender\n-\tHow these perceptions about linguistic varieties reproduce inequality and other power relations."],["Learning Objectives","Through participation in learning activities, students will:\n1. Develop an understanding of the role of communication, across cross-cultural contexts.\n2. Identify how anthropologists examine language and communication ethnographically.\n3. Locate and relate current linguistic significance in everyday life to course concepts or themes.\n4. Establish and defend a position regarding the role of a particular speech or communication style in everyday life through original writing and speaking."],["Class Materials (Required)","Required materials will be provided on Canvas"],["Class Materials (Suggested)","Basso, K.

At the same time, as Black and Indigenous authors and theorists highlight, some communities are already living in a post-apocalyptic dystopian world, which raises the question of: whose \"world\" ends at the end of the world and what \"world\" can we envision beyond this one? What kind of planetary imaginary or thinking do we require to imagine an elsewhere that is beyond forms of capitalist and colonial violence? What genres or forms of narrative could accommodate the multi-scalar issues around climate change, ecocide, and environmental shifts? In line with Amitav Ghosh's (2016, 9) proclamation that \"the climate crisis is also a crisis of culture, and thus of imagination,\" this course interrogates how contemporary global fiction, film, and art, allows us to imagine alternative futures through lens of apocalyptic past and present. We will draw on theoretical scholarship from environmental humanities, postcolonial theory, Indigenous studies, and animal studies, especially through the writings of Kyle Whyte, Amitav Ghosh, Kathryn Yusoff, Ursula Heise, Rob Nixon, Tim Choy and Robin Kimmerer.

Public health interventions require cooperation and partnerships at each level and with civil society organizations, corporations, businesses and individuals. Advances in technology can significantly reduce the burden of disease and improve the quality of health and life. To effectively address global health challenges, technology must be integrated into health systems in ways that are both appropriate and sustainable. These interventions are affected by public policies, availability of resources and theories of public health and disease. Existing health organizations are increasingly challenged by the scope and magnitude of the current and future threats to public health such as the COVID-19 pandemic; the emergence of new and more virulent infectious diseases; the threats of bio-terrorism; growing resistance to antibiotics; lack of basic infrastructure of water, sanitation and inadequate access to drugs in developing countries; and overabundance of foods and complications from affluence, leading to health problems such as cardio-vascular disease and diabetes in higher income countries. This course will examine the global epidemiology of these diseases and threats to the populations of the world, and the current technological and organizational strategies that have been established to respond.

In carrying out this study, we plumb the linguist's toolkit (which includes tools borrowed from mathematics, logic, language acquisition, and experimental psychology) to discover how language scientists determine what a given word or sentence means, and whether that word or sentence means the same thing across occasions of use. This inquiry will lead the student to an understanding of the scientific study of language, by examining how it plays out in the domain of linguistic meaning.
