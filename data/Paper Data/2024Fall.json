challenging elements of professional singing - the audition process. Every aspect of auditions will be considered, from the résumé to the creation of repertoire lists, the research regarding the particular organization and personnel for which a singer is auditioning, and the audition itself, from entrance onstage to introduction, performance, and exit. Also important will be the discussion of every possible circumstance a singer may face within the audition venue."],["Registration Requirements","•\tThe student should have the understanding that prior to the beginning of the course, students will be asked by the instructor to send a list of every operatic aria they have already learned, any operatic aria they are working on at that time, and any operatic aria they would be interested in learning. From these lists, the instructor will prepare a schedule of what each student will sing in class, and when. Any aria that a student sings in class will be evaluated as a possible aria for inclusion in an audition \"package\" for that student.\n•\tSTUDENTS CANNOT UNDERTAKE THIS COURSE WITHOUT AT LEAST FOUR ARIAS THAT ARE READY TO PERFORM."],["Learning Objectives","•\tThe course will confront every factor that can sabotage auditions and give students the tools to conquer those obstacles.\n•\tThe hope is for students to finish the course with a thorough understanding of how they should proceed in all aspects of the actual audition process, both in terms of the materials the singer presents to audition judges, the singer's entrance and exit, communication with the pianist as well as with the auditions judges, and the performance itself.\n•\tSignificant attention will be devoted to priorities in choosing audition repertoire.\n•\tEach student will meet with the instructor regarding repertoire, in a one-on-one conference via Zoom. As a result, students will finish the course having created wo suitable lists of appropriate audition arias (five to offer in the audition, and five to have \"in reserve\" for that audition should other selections be requested).\n•\tThe ultimate goal of the course is to help students actually enjoy auditioning, rather than dreading it or being intimidated by it."],["Teaching Method","In class sessions: •\tStudents will engage with the instructor in very extensive discussions of each element of the audition process. •\tWith the limitless resource of YouTube, it will be possible for the class as a group to watch individuals and critique them, by way of witnessing both the right way and the wrong way to audition. •\tIt is anticipated that there will be a written assignment, in which students will compare and contrast auditions viewed on YouTube. •\tEach class session will involve the students' own singing - most probably four students per session. The feedback students receive will be given in the most constructive way possible and with maximum conskderation for each student, whether coming from the instructor or from fellow students. •\tUp to three guest teachers from the world of professional opera (names TBA) will attend one class session each, and every student will have the opportunity to coach in class with one of the guest teachers.\n•\tFor the final, each student will perform an aria as if in a professional audition."],["Evaluation Method","Students will be evaluated on:\n•\ttheir class participation, which should be extensive; •\tthe degree of thoroughness and attention they to detail in their resumé and audition lists; •\tthe seriousness with which they address audition feedback, whether receiving it themselves or offering it to a colleague; •\tthe thoroughness of their preparation and execution of everything they perform in class - including, above all, the mock audition that will be the final for the course. They will be expected to handle the final exactly as they would a professional audition, in terms of not only their performance but also the materials they present and the way they comport themselves in every moment of the audition."],["Class Materials (Required)","None at this time."],["Class Materials (Suggested)","None at this time."],["Class Notes","In the business of opera, auditions are one of the most sensitive subjects for all singers at all stages of a career.

challenging elements of professional singing - the audition process. Every aspect of auditions will be considered, from the résumé to the creation of repertoire lists, the research regarding the particular organization and personnel for which a singer is auditioning, and the audition itself, from entrance onstage to introduction, performance, and exit. Also important will be the discussion of every possible circumstance a singer may face within the audition venue."],["Registration Requirements","•\tThe student should have the understanding that prior to the beginning of the course, students will be asked by the instructor to send a list of every operatic aria they have already learned, any operatic aria they are working on at that time, and any operatic aria they would be interested in learning. From these lists, the instructor will prepare a schedule of what each student will sing in class, and when. Any aria that a student sings in class will be evaluated as a possible aria for inclusion in an audition \"package\" for that student.\n•\tSTUDENTS CANNOT UNDERTAKE THIS COURSE WITHOUT AT LEAST FOUR ARIAS THAT ARE READY TO PERFORM."],["Learning Objectives","•\tThe course will confront every factor that can sabotage auditions and give students the tools to conquer those obstacles.\n•\tThe hope is for students to finish the course with a thorough understanding of how they should proceed in all aspects of the actual audition process, both in terms of the materials the singer presents to audition judges, the singer's entrance and exit, communication with the pianist as well as with the auditions judges, and the performance itself.\n•\tSignificant attention will be devoted to priorities in choosing audition repertoire.\n•\tEach student will meet with the instructor regarding repertoire, in a one-on-one conference via Zoom. As a result, students will finish the course having created wo suitable lists of appropriate audition arias (five to offer in the audition, and five to have \"in reserve\" for that audition should other selections be requested).\n•\tThe ultimate goal of the course is to help students actually enjoy auditioning, rather than dreading it or being intimidated by it."],["Teaching Method","In class sessions: •\tStudents will engage with the instructor in very extensive discussions of each element of the audition process. •\tWith the limitless resource of YouTube, it will be possible for the class as a group to watch individuals and critique them, by way of witnessing both the right way and the wrong way to audition. •\tIt is anticipated that there will be a written assignment, in which students will compare and contrast auditions viewed on YouTube. •\tEach class session will involve the students' own singing - most probably four students per session. The feedback students receive will be given in the most constructive way possible and with maximum conskderation for each student, whether coming from the instructor or from fellow students. •\tUp to three guest teachers from the world of professional opera (names TBA) will attend one class session each, and every student will have the opportunity to coach in class with one of the guest teachers.\n•\tFor the final, each student will perform an aria as if in a professional audition."],["Evaluation Method","Students will be evaluated on:\n•\ttheir class participation, which should be extensive; •\tthe degree of thoroughness and attention they to detail in their resumé and audition lists; •\tthe seriousness with which they address audition feedback, whether receiving it themselves or offering it to a colleague; •\tthe thoroughness of their preparation and execution of everything they perform in class - including, above all, the mock audition that will be the final for the course. They will be expected to handle the final exactly as they would a professional audition, in terms of not only their performance but also the materials they present and the way they comport themselves in every moment of the audition."],["Class Materials (Required)","None at this time."],["Class Materials (Suggested)","None at this time."],["Class Notes","In the business of opera, auditions are one of the most sensitive subjects for all singers at all stages of a career.

You will engage in interactive exercises with other students, which will mirror US law firm style group work. Class time will include minimal lectures, with an emphasis on interactive group projects that mimic the type of assignments that law firms receive from clients.

In past semesters, CFJC students have participated in successful efforts to close two Illinois juvenile prisons, expand expungement rights for people with juvenile records, and shorten young people's length of incarceration, parole, and probation. This semester students will participate in an effort to create a fully funded statewide public defense system in Illinois' as the current public defense \"system\" is underfunded, overburdened and violates indigent defendants' Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Illinois is one of only eight states without a statewide public defense system. Students will collaborate with a wide range of advocates, public defenders, community groups and others impacted by the current public defense \"system\" to pass legislation which would bring Illinois into compliance with the Sixth Amendment.

The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the materials currently in use in magnetic data storage and processing, together with an overview of the recording and read processes in magnetic hard disc drives, as well as development of next generation magnetic memories. Further to give the student enough theory background in magnetism and magnetic materials to understand WHY particular materials are favored. The course is not quantum-mechanical in outlook as this is not really necessary to explain the materials choices. The main theoretical background will be used to arrive at an understanding of the basic energy terms that control the properties of magnetic materials when they are patterned at the nanoscale. Magnetic device sizes are fast becoming smaller than the limit for semiconductor devices and this places considerable challenges on the materials systems that can be used.

In the process of learning techniques in UX Design, you will more broadly be exploring the UX Design process. The UX Design process emphasizes collaboration and rapid iteration - expressing and testing ideas with an audience in a virtuous cycle. This course will require extensive exploration, creation, experimentation, and communication. The course is intended for those who are new to UX Design (and design in general) and will enable you to understand what goes into building intuitive digital experiences. After the week you will certainly not walk away as a \"full-stack\" designer, but will be equipped with foundations, tools, terminology, and mindsets in UX design that can be applied within various contexts. Learning Outcomes Explore foundations in visual design and communication such as Typography, Iconography, Grids, Layouts and Hierarchy, Color Theory.\nUnderstand the UX Design process and how user research and validation is used to build digital applications.

South Asian businesses on Devon Avenue sell paratha and saris, and community centers support newly settled families. Shops in Chinatown on Cermak Road sell traditional herbal cures and non-profits focus on immigrant rights and health concerns. A volunteer-run school in the suburb of Des Plaines offers weekly Mandarin lessons to first, second and third generation Chinese-American families who hope their American-born children will stay connected to their roots. A Chicago improv troupe called Stir Friday Night, made up of up-and-coming Asian American comedians, has performed for more than 25 years. In this course, we will explore and produce stories of Asian Americans at a pivotal time in history. Asian American cultural, social and political influence is on the rise. Kamala Harris is the first Black and South Asian American candidate on a major party's presidential ticket. Minnesota native Sunisa Lee became the first Hmong American to participate in the Olympics and the became the first Asian American to win an all-around gymnastics gold medal. Still, while Marvel featured Shang Chi and K-Pop tops U.S. Billboard charts, anti-Asian rhetoric, discrimination and attacks rose. Asian Americans are confronting their own bias and racism, as well. We will study journalistic work that explore the complex histories of Asians who have settled in the United States since before this nation's founding, the discrimination people faced and the opportunities they pursued. We will hear from and about Asian American journalists, activists, artists and leaders. This class is for anyone who wants to better understand the role of media and journalists covering communities of color. We will explore issues of identity, race and ethnicity, nationality and class.

Since Medill has a campus in Qatar, we consult comparative law examples interpretive of Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights. We begin the course normatively, by putting all this in the context of First Amendment theory and doctrine.

What is the role of the news media in reporting the news, assessing it, critiquing it, contextualizing it in contributing to enlightened public decision making? How might the conventions of journalism—the traditional rules and practices that guide our work—be used against the objectives of journalism? Through assigned readings and robust discussion, this seminar will explore the dynamics of public opinion and attempts to manipulate it. Against the backdrop of media coverage of current events, we will come to understand the framework for propaganda, its elements, how it works and how it has been used in the construction and reinforcement of social difference. Ultimately, we will see how this process has been weaponized—pitting identifiable groups against each other—in the process of assuming and maintaining political power. In this process, we will see how the term \"fake news\" has been used in an effort to undermine media credibility and cause public confusion about what to believe. Ironically, and unsurprisingly, we will see that the very people charging \"fake news\" are the ones generating it. In the end, we must consider our role as journalists in this process. How have we been complicit? What is our responsibility to ensure a deeper public appreciation of the value of social difference?

There will be opportunities to travel to Springfield to start getting experience in statehouse reporting, as well, schedules permitting. Students may also explore early reporting assignments with the Medill's partner, Capitol News of Illinois. This is an election year and a chance to do state political coverage. American politics in the 21st Century have become increasingly divided, bitter and rancorous, culminating in the Jan. 6 insurrection by a violent mob storming the U.S. Capitol and an attempt by members of Congress to undo the lawful result of the 2020 presidential election. Protests in Chicago and Milwaukee during the 2024 Democratic and Republican National Conventions underscored the divisions in the heartland and across the U.S. on issues ranging from the war in Gaza to the fight over abortion rights. The 2024 presidential campaign playing out during this Fall Quarter course provides excellent lessons in real time for discussion in a seminar setting of state and national politics, how to cover them and the bitter partisanship besetting the country. Illinois government is a Democratic stronghold now but also a microcosm of the shifting politics of the Midwest, and over much earlier decades it was a key swing state leaning red and conservative Republican before turning deep blue and liberal Democratic. From the policy battles in the state legislature to the rivalry between Chicago and Downstate politicians, this course will instruct students in effective ways to cover stories ranging from legislation in the Illinois Capitol to the workings of state government, politics and power, corruption and the public good. The class is a preamble for students in the Politics, Policy and Foreign Affairs specialization. It is also part of an unprecedented new program by Medill to proactively help fill some of the gaps in Illinois state news coverage amid the dangerous decline of traditional media outlets. Two U.S. newspapers are disappearing every week. Since 2005, more than 2,500 newspapers have closed, news deserts have emerged across America and local news coverage has declined—spurring an erosion of knowledge among citizens about news in their local communities and about the world in general, which threatens civic knowledge, voter engagement and democracy. Not since the civil unrest of the 1960s and 1970s have journalists faced such challenges in covering Americans' partisanship, extremism, tribalism, racial division and demonization of their fellow citizens. Nor has the role of the news media been so fraught and fractured in its mission to tell the most objective available version of the truth across multiple news platforms. Reporters must sort through facts and \"alternative facts,\" political spin and personal attacks, a malevolent matrix of social media propaganda and even charges that the press is \"the enemy of the people.\" They also must examine systemic racism and the role of journalism in addressing it or perpetuating it. Today's local and national political divides, however, are not happening in a vacuum. They harken back to the protests and upheaval in the Vietnam and Watergate eras and the long struggle for civil rights, the New Deal policies of FDR and the conservative crusade of the Reagan Revolution.

Although Africa has been represented on screen essentially since the birth of cinema, it is only within the last 60 years that it has had a cinema of its own in which African filmmakers made their own films. In the early 20th - century colonial powers used cinema as ethnography and propaganda to represent Africa as savage, dark, mysterious, and dangerous to legitimize their oppressive regimes. Hollywood also\nmisrepresented Africans in popular films such as the Tarzan series (1918 - 2016) and King Solomon's Mines (1937). While this course acknowledges this pre-history, it is ultimately interested in the period beginning in the 1960's when most African nations gained independence. We will tackle a variety of filmic forms, aesthetic, and ideologies employed by African filmmakers from the independence era until today including (but not limited to) social realism, anti-colonialism, short films, animation, avantgardism, and science fiction. We will also examine the social and political issues that many African films address including gender politics, racism, Eurocentrism, migration, corruption, human rights, and Westernization while also acknowledging that we need not saddle African cinema with a burden of representing Africa any more than we do for any other cinema. In other words, African cinema is also entertainment. Moreover, we will discuss how films are circulated, funded, distributed, and consumed - including the role of piracy. Primarily, the course focuses on sub-Saharan black African cinema but does include some North African films to gesture to the enormity of the geography covered by African Film Studies.\"</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li> Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li> Sophomores and above</li>\n<li> Open for cross-registration</li>\n<li> Satisfies Africana Studies Minor & Film and Design Minor & Media & Politics Minor</li>\n</ul>"]]}]},{"i":"021939","c":"DOHA","t":"Research Methods in Comm Studies","u":"GEN_CMN","n":"201-0","s":[{"i":"021939-70","r":[{"n":"Rajiv Kumar Mishra"}],"t":"Research Methods in Comm Studies","u":"GEN_CMN","n":"201-0","s":"70","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":1,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 2-255"],"d":"2024-08-25","e":"2024-12-05","c":"LEC","a":23,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for COMM Majors who are Sophomores and above.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>This course introduces students to the basic research concepts, methods, and tools used to design, conduct, and interpret studies in communication and other fields.

By this point in the journalism program, students are expected to have advanced writing skills so that we may focus more on the various structures and approaches to magazine writing. Students are expected to develop their story ideas (in close consultation with your instructor and classmates) and find sources required to produce interesting and well-told stories. Also, you will produce your own multi-media accompaniments to your stories.

In order to shed light on the often-overlooked history of girls' media, this course offers a critical investigation of (primarily) U.S. girls' media from the 1930s to the present, including novels, films, TV shows, advertisements, music videos, teen magazines, toys, and new media. We will investigate girls' media artifacts as aesthetic, political, and commercial texts through which youth have interfaced with lessons about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, national identity, and generation at different historical moments. Although American commercial media will be taken up as our main object of study, students will have opportunities to explore media made outside the U.S. in their own research projects, and we will consider girls' independent production and reception practices in both Western and non-Western contexts. Ultimately, the goals of the course are: 1) to explore the dominant strategies utilized by the media industries to represent female youth and their concerns, as well as those utilized by girls in practices of self-representation; 2) to examine girls' reception of and diverse engagements with media; and 3) to consider how the landscape of girls' media production and consumption has changed, and resisted change, over time. </p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None </li>\n<li>Open to Sophomores and above, MIT majors only </li>\n</li>"]]},{"i":"021975-71","r":[{"n":"Shehram Mokhtar"}],"t":"Film, Media & Gender","k":"Gender in Film","u":"MIT","n":"325-0","s":"71","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":8,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":15}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 1-245"],"d":"2024-08-25","e":"2024-12-05","c":"LEC","a":23,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Seats are reserved for sophomores & above who have completed MIT 220-0 Registration is reserved for NU Qatar COMM students.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>This course explores how the issues of gender are integral to understand and analyze film form or moving images.

They may be long, short, general, specific, civil, transgressive, violent, and non-violent. They are often protest movements seeking to bring about social change. They are usually concerned with rectifying an existing social \"wrong\"—something unjust, oppressive, discriminatory, or exclusionary—by directly mobilizing people through non-traditional political and judicial routes. In many cases, social movements involve \"demands\" that aim to capture public attention and pressure governmental action. This course will seek to further our understanding of social movements by posing and exploring a series of questions: Why do social movements occur, often in clusters, more frequently in some periods than in others? What are the main theories of social movements? How have social movements changed over time? How has our understanding of social movements changed over time? What are social movement organizations (SMOs) and how do they function? Why do some people, not others, become active participants in social movements? How has globalization affected social movements? How have new technologies of information and communications influenced the scope and function of social movements? What are the strategies and tactics, both discursive and non-discursive, that social movements deploy to publicize their goals and demands? Why do some social movements succeed while others fail? Why do so many social movements decay, decline, and disappear?"],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbook required."]]}]},{"i":"004231","c":"SPCH","t":"Community Integration of Labeled People","u":"COMM_ST","n":"340-0","s":[{"i":"004231-1","r":[{"n":"Paul Howard Arntson"}],"t":"Community Integration of Labeled People","u":"COMM_ST","n":"340-0","s":"1","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 2407"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":40,"p":[["Overview of class","Examination of local integration initiatives, the role of professionals, the language used to describe the initiatives, the social service system's responses, and the agents and communities that have constructed inclusive environments for people labeled with disabilities."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbook required."]]}]},{"i":"025201","c":"SPCH","t":"Interactive Museum Exhibit Design","u":"COMM_ST","n":"374-0","s":[{"i":"025201-1","r":[{"n":"Duri Lucille Lampe Long"}],"t":"Interactive Museum Exhibit Design","u":"COMM_ST","n":"374-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Parkes Hall 214"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":30}]},{"i":"025076","c":"SPCH","t":"Critical Internet Studies","u":"COMM_ST","n":"387-0","s":[{"i":"025076-1","r":[{"n":"Sulafa S Zidani"}],"t":"Critical Internet Studies","u":"COMM_ST","n":"387-0","s":"1","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":20}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 2370"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"SEM","a":25,"p":[["Overview of class","This course focuses on current issues in the field of Critical Internet Studies, with special attention directed to power dynamics related to the use and of internet-related technologies.

And third, how do rogue players such as hackers, trolls, and other malevolent forces infiltrate individualized news sources, such as social media feeds, to promote some candidates and denigrate others? These are extremely complicated questions. To limit our inquiry, the course will center on presidential elections, drawing on a limited number of case studies that will include: the 1968 contest between Nixon and Humphrey; the 2004 contest between Bush and Kerry; and the 2016 contest between Trump and Clinton.

In MLK's political imagination (which owes much to Gandhi), direct action refers to a mode of political mobilization, a \"movement\"-based mobilization and stagings of \"the people\" that function as an alternative to a parliamentary/electoral mode of acquiring power/influence over the state and its policies. Direct action is also regarded as an alternative to the legal route for redressing grievances when the court delays and denies social justice. MLK, like Gandhi, links or equates direct action with the non-violent modes of mobilization and stagings of the people.\nIn this seminar, we will explore a different and alternative genealogy (not necessarily violent) of direct action in terms of crowds, riots, and uprisings which are molecular and local rather than molar and national in terms of scope, temporality, and addressivity. This course will enable the students to rethink direct action—in all its ubiquity—in the context of our age, an era characterized by rapid growth, selective affluence, and abundance, all amidst deepening inequality across the globe.

In its classes we accompany all exercises, improvisations, and partnered movement-scenes with jazz-based scat-singing. We also use scat-singing's percussive quality to sing the words of songs that accompany some exercises. This prominent use of the voice turns this approach to performing arts training into an energy-charged, acting-singing class as much as a movement class. We also sing the lyrics to songs - but, again, singing them in this jazz-inflected way. Note the phrase \"energy-charged.\" Jump Rhythm focuses on articulating the physical and emotional ENERGY we feel roiling about on the inside of our bodies, rather than on articulating the SPACE we see on the outside of the body, whether our own or another person's. That is, this class is not like what you may have experienced in a typical, ballet-based dance class. In the latter much of the learning depends on using a mirror to help you rearrange the positions of your body parts so that they can conform to a pre-established \"look.\" There is also a continuous emphasis placed on the legs - learning how to place them in non-natural positions so we can turn them into marvelous engines of gymnastic virtuosity. Differently, Jump Rhythm focuses on expressing energy through our 2 eyes, 2 hands, and voice. We call these our 5 primary physical and emotional articulators. Actors and singers know these parts, especially the voice, as the means they use to deliver the words of a play or a song Given that Jump Rhythm is a both music-driven and acting-driven class, we team them up these small but might articulators to express clear rhythmic accents. That is, we use eyes-hands-voice as drumbeaters to strike sharp or explosive accents against the drumheads of the space with, as best we can, pinpoint accurate timing. These drumheads include the imaginary spaces that surround the body; the actual surfaces of the body we tap hands against and use like beatbox; and that very real drumhead loved by all tap and step dancers: the floor. In addition to the fact that we focus on expressing energy not shape, and in addition to the fact that we rhythmically vocalize all the movement we do, Jump Rhythm is also different from a typical ballet-based dance classes in one more way: it is built upon the foundation of a holistic approach to mind-body health called Standing Down Straight®. Standing Down Straight®. In Jump Rhythm, we do not explore movement or sing music using either an uplifted posture (\"standing up straight\") or core strength (over-contracted abdominal muscles). Differently, we do all voice-and-body work by standing down straight (SDS). SDS is a \"green,\" less-is-more pedagogy. With it, we explore learning how to use less muscular tension when driving force through the body and voice.\tIn this way we honor the animal in us - to the extent that we wish to emulate how our animal cousins know how to get what they want with ease, economy, fluency, and pinpoint power. Inspired by this model, we explore how to work from a base of anatomically fact-based, gravity-directed, skeletal relaxation. This inspiration in mind, we build into every activity of this class when not just to \"do,\" to \"perform,\" but also when to slow down both the mind and the body. Slowing them down so that we can teach the bones of our body not to lift and hypertense - which, for instance, standing up straight and core strength promote - but rather to \"sit\" and \"hang\" in response to gravity's downward pull. In sum: SDS allows us to, in a sense, not-work as well as work. We practice this apparently paradoxical approach to moving and vocalizing in all of our exercises beginning with the one called Constructive Rest. In it, we use visualizations to help the body's bones go where the pull of gravity is directing them to go"],["Registration Requirements","Sophomore, Juniors, and Senior Theatre majors who have taken Dance 161 JRJ I"]]}]},{"i":"004728","c":"SPCH","t":"Classical Dance II","u":"DANCE","n":"270-0","s":[{"i":"004728-20","r":[{"n":"Michael Francis Landez"}],"t":"Classical Dance II","u":"DANCE","n":"270-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":20}],"l":["Wirtz Center Ballroom"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":19,"p":[["Overview of class","This course aims to reinforce and build upon movement fundamentals, terminology, and performance skills of ballet at an intermediate level.

Yet as this crucial debate around the ethics of pedagogy has grown, there has been no robust discussion about how we treat these same works in research contexts. What does it mean to feel morally conflicted about picking a novel, theorist, film or image for a class, but less so when it comes to analyzing that same material in an article or talk? As scholars, why do we want our object to be \"good\" all the time?\nThis is a class about what happens when good scholars study bad things, highlighting how this practice has always been a key part of critique. It is often by running up against critical thought that a media work becomes \"ethical\" or \"unethical\" in the first place. Moreover, the question of how to engage with \"unethical media\" motivates a whole array of critical argumentative comportments - it shows us how to canonize, how to excuse, how to elevate, how to politicize, how to aestheticize, how to love or hate - and in this way the question of ethics helps us to assume the identity of a scholar. To gain perspective on this process, our class will look at the intersection of contemporary theory and moral philosophy, along with films, photographs, graphic novels and radio dramas that try to deal morally with issues of aesthetic distance, visual violence, cancel culture, scholarly privilege, disgrace, eco-pessimism, and the ethical representation of sexuality, gender expression and race.\nTexts change a little from year to year.

A professional Equity actor in a Tier 2 or 3 house is expected to do eight performances a week. Because professional voice users are at greater risk for developing voice disorders and the consequences for even a minor voice disorder can have a significant impact on the user ability to perform. The goal of the voice section of this class is to develop both the actor's speaking voice to communicate with an audience both for stage, film, tv and audio performances and to free the actor's body with the goal of developing a performer's ability to move and speak at the same time freely and without tension. Movement puts us in the present moment. Sensing through our bodies is how we can function, perceive, relate, and react to people and things in our environment. As performers, the way you embody a character or a role is essential to be able to accurately portray a whole person, and for you to create a whole other life within your bodymind. Taking care of your body is an invaluable and lifelong process that takes time, consistency, and practice. In the movement section of this course, you will learn the fundamentals of embodiment, or how to both feel and express through your body. By learning anatomical connections of the breath and musculoskeletal system, practicing detailed movement exercises, engaging in sensory awareness meditations, and playing physical games with your peers, you will gain an introductory knowledge of how your body functions and how to move expressively and effectively on stage. The class will involve two separate sections which will be taught by two professors: Linda Gates will teach Voice and Chrissy Martin will teach Movement. Each course section will take two days of movement and two days of voice. This course culminates in a performance combining lessons learned in both movement and voice sections.\""],["Registration Requirements","First year theatre majors only"]]}]},{"i":"016531","c":"SPCH","t":"Fundamentals of Stage Directing","u":"THEATRE","n":"211-0","s":[{"i":"016531-20","r":[{"n":"Francesca Patron"}],"t":"Fundamentals of Stage Directing","u":"THEATRE","n":"211-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Wirtz Center SOUTH"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: No First Years Students (By Advising Cohort Milestone)","p":[["Overview of class","This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamental principles and techniques of stage direction.

The goal of MSED 407-1 and 407-2 is to help you become informed educators who are able to turn curiosities and challenges from your settings into potential areas of structured reflection and research.

pressing social problems (e.g. inequality, discrimination, illness, hunger, poverty, violence) and the creation and implementation of policies meant to address them. Policy can define much of social life. It can determine who receives access to resources and services and who does not; what types of behavior are restricted and punished, and what types are rewarded; and how individual needs are balanced with a (far from consensus-) understanding of the collective, common good. Social policy, in other words, exists in a contested space, and one that shapes opportunities, resource structures, and life outcomes for individuals and communities. In the first part of the course, we will explore the political process by which these important policies are made. We will interrogate why some social problems receive more policy attention than others, how and by whom policy agendas are set, whose voices are listened to, and under what conditions meaningful policy change and transformation occurs. In the second part of the course, we will focus on policy implementation, exploring how policy moves through the regulatory system and is eventually carried out by front-line workers (e.g. teachers, social workers, police officers) who interface with the public. We will investigate how these interactions impact individuals and communities, ultimately shaping what the consequences of policy look like on the ground. Throughout the quarter, students will learn how to frame, write, and present a policy brief on an important social issue. We are excited to learn with you this quarter and to create an engaged, compassionate space for thinking about the most pressing social issues around us today."],["Teaching Method","Lecture, discussion, and group work."],["Evaluation Method","papers and group project"],["Class Materials (Required)","Eric M.

Correlations help to predict outcomes, but if we want to influence outcomes we need to understand causal pathways. It is not sufficient to observe what is happening, we need to know why it is happening. In this course students will learn the toolbox of causal inference econometrics with applications to the economics of health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing. The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-indifference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. We will also discuss causal evidence derived from theoretical models and machine learning. Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (\"happiness\") are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. They matter as an outcome for people's lives and they matter as an input into economic and social productivity. Moreover, health, human capital, and happiness are impacted by behaviors and by social and environmental conditions - factors that can be impacted via social policies. To develop effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. We will discuss fetal origins, the impact of air pollution on health, causes and consequences of mental illness in childhood and youth, the impact of income on health, trends in mortality, the economic drivers of fertility, happiness across countries and over time, and the roots of midlife crisis."],["Registration Requirements","Any of these three courses are required as a prerequisite: SESP 310: Causal Methods for Evaluating Policy\nECON 281: Applied Econometrics\nSTAT 328: Causal Inference Exceptions are possible but require our specific permission.

The primary goal of this course is to strengthen oral and written communication and comprehension skills as well as cross-cultural competence by immersing students in authentic cultural contexts, materials, and language and by engaging in a variety of communicative activities. A review and deepening of essential grammar will reinforce linguistic foundations. The teaching methodology for this course uses the flipped model: students learn grammar and vocabulary at home with Flipped French, a pioneering courseware developed by faculty in the French Department at Northwestern. Class activities are devoted to conversation and other communicative activities that allow students to practice what they learned while exploring contemporary French and Francophone cultures. This course enables students to actively participate in a French-speaking environment, prepare for further studies in French, and provide a path to proficiency. This hybrid course meets on campus/in person once weekly with online activities during the week. Students are expected to attend the weekly in-person class and actively participate, to complete the online activities during the week, and to spend at least two hours of work outside of class for each hour of class.

We will examine the nature of a profession and the reasons professional ethics are necessary, and we will look at specific moral issues like deception, confidentiality, whistleblowing, and sustainability. We will look in detail at moral issues in specific professions like medicine, business, law, and public health, though the course is intended as an introduction to professional ethics in general. This is a philosophy course, so our aim is not to memorize a list of do's and don'ts. Rather, our goal is to understand and critically assess the moral theories and principles that ethicists have developed to address problems in professional ethics. This course will thus help you develop your skills in understanding, analyzing, and constructing arguments. The course is conducted completely online. A technology fee will be added to tuition.

Figures such as the translator, the voyager, the mystic, the knight, the artist lie at the core of his literary work as well as his writings on ethics and politics.

What might account for these common findings? In this course we explore two related ideas to gain insights into these issues. The first is that many modern ailments may be viewed as an imbalance between modern life ways and those which shaped our biology during much of human evolution. The second is that differences in factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical factors, help explain why some groups tend to be more affected by these conditions than others. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive and sensitive to the environments that we inhabit.

We will begin in the present and work our way backwards, looking first at the impact of globalization on the conditions underlying art making, exhibiting and viewing. Emerging paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. The social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes will lead us to track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and to question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. With these developments as our framework, we will then review and update notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and question the status today of more traditional media like painting and sculpture, as well as re-evaluate the idea of the avant-garde and its long-held desire to merge art and life.

In addition to excavating the long histories and present problems surrounding medical racism, another goal of this course is tracking the medicalization of race itself. As such, we will challenge commonly held perceptions of bodies, pain, ability, and the constitution of equitable futures. We will also supplement our reading with guest lectures from medical professionals working at the intersection of race and medicine.Students will take away from the class a deeper grasp of the discourse surrounding race and medicine, as well as how to deploy this knowledge in their critical interpretations of cultural production. Some conceptual questions for consideration include the following: how do texts by writers of color challenge normative assessments of what constitutes health and wellness? How do we ethically consider race and medicine without resorting to postracial idealism?

Every year, the studios in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) put out hundreds of movies, in addition to hundreds more that are released by India's other film industries in languages like Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali. Most of these movies are full of songs and dances, and bring action, comedy, tragedy, and romance together into one (often very complex) story. As the subject of our class has said, Hindi cinema \"offers poetic justice in three hours. You walk away with a smile on your lips and dried tears on your cheeks.\" Film industries everywhere choose a few actors to elevate above all others. The biggest of these movie stars in India, and perhaps in the world, is Amitabh Bachchan. With his brooding, rebellious charisma, not to mention his ready wit, resonant baritone voice, and enviable dance moves, his \"angry young man\" persona dominated the films of the 1970s. Today, half a century after his film debut, he is still a major star. His face and voice are instantly recognizable, not only throughout South Asia and its diaspora, but in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere. As his characters have aged from youthful rebels to somewhat less youthful rebels to stern patriarchs to goofy old men obsessed with their digestive tracts, he has at times seemed inescapable off the movie screen as well. He has spent time in politics, hosted a wildly successful game show, and starred in children's comic books; one fan has even built a temple to worship him as a literal idol.\nIn this course, we will focus on Amitabh Bachchan, not only because he and his films are so interesting, but because he has so much to tell us about how Indian films work and what a star is.

The course will be structured in two parts: in the first part students will be encouraged to build expertise in the basic concepts, definitions, and general academic consensus (as well as debates) about categories including \"religion,\" \"violence,\" \"sacrifice,\" \"ritual,\" \"martyrdom,\" and also \"nationalism,\" \"politics,\" and \"terrorism\" through reading both primary sources (in English translation) and secondary sources (scholarly writings). We will then move into an analysis of case studies that focus on specific circumstances where Buddhist rhetoric, scriptural authority, and religious practices have played a role in violence including suicide, terrorist-related actions, and self-immolation predominantly in pre- and modern Asia. Some of the provocative questions that this course asks include: Why and how is religion involved in politics? Is Buddhism a pacifist religion? How does religion rationalize violence? How can some Buddhist leaders embrace terror as a political tool? Are the recent practices of self-immolation in Tibet acts of violence?

Board of Education case transformed schooling for Black children and their communities. In considering the impact of the Brown decision on the experiences of Black students in U.S. public schools, we interrogate the rebukes of Brown including the various educational projects (community control, Panther freedom schools, the Black independent school movement etc.) advanced in Brown's aftermath. In the second section of the course, we explore the myriad ways Black students experience antiblackness and anti-Black racism in U.S. public schools contemporarily, as well as the ways Black students, educators, administrators, community and family members, and scholars have articulated what the notion of liberation may mean in the face of antiblackness.

Each of these develops claims-making skills. This assessment foregrounds the ability to foster respectful debate. The short papers will review examples from the readings about Black liberation experiments, and the classroom discussions will allow students to learn from each other and sharpen their critical analytical skills.

What was the Tricontinental and why was Cuba so involved in southern Africa? What role did the Sino-Soviet split play in African decolonization and international solidarity efforts? Why was the Sixth Pan African Congress in Tanzania such a flashpoint for a Black Nationalist/Left schism? What was its aftermath? How did the rise of Black feminism shape US solidarity struggles? How did race and racism shape US solidarity campaigns with the Angolan and Mozambican liberation movements and the antiapartheid movement? What were sources of leadership in the solidarity movements and what role did churches, unions, students play?

Students will explore how hedge funds evaluate these opportunities and capitalize on them to drive returns for their investors. The course will help students understand the concept of arbitrage and the limits of arbitrage opportunities.<br/>\nThere will be a particular focus on asking why outsized returns exist in specific cases of market inefficiency.

We will explore the properties of these materials and why quantum mechanical effects allow for this scale to be so important. Discussions of medicines, electronics, catalysts, additives, and imaging agents that include nanoparticles will allow us to explore the wide range of current directions of nanotechnology.

As there will be carryover of topics from one quarter to the next, the 3 quarters of the course must be taken in the designated sequence. As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors. The full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of: instrumental analysis\nsynthesis of inorganic compounds\nsynthesis of organic compounds\nspectroscopy The course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example: - A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure. Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made. - A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest. In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses. Chemistry 350-1: Roughly half of this course deals with the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The rest of this course deals with advanced techniques of synthetic organic chemistry, but you will be expected to use mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, as well as the techniques of IR and UV/visible spectroscopy that you have learned previously, to characterize the compounds that you synthesize."],["Registration Requirements","Prerequisites: CHEM 220-0; and CHEM 215-3 or CHEM 212-3, and CHEM 235-3 (C- or better); or equivalent."],["Class Materials (Required)","No materials are required for this course."]]},{"i":"017794-21","t":"Advanced Laboratory 1","u":"CHEM","n":"350-1","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute B160"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LAB"},{"i":"017794-22","t":"Advanced Laboratory 1","u":"CHEM","n":"350-1","s":"22","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute B160"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LAB"}]},{"i":"001488","c":"WCAS","t":"Undergraduate Seminar","u":"CHEM","n":"398-0","s":[{"i":"001488-21","t":"Undergraduate Seminar","u":"CHEM","n":"398-0","s":"21","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":4}]},{"i":"016885","c":"WCAS","t":"Principles of Physical Chemistry","u":"CHEM","n":"403-0","s":[{"i":"016885-01","r":[{"n":"Songi Han"}],"t":"Principles of Physical Chemistry","u":"CHEM","n":"403-0","s":"01","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":8,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":20}],"l":["Technological Institute MG28"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":35,"p":[["Overview of class","The focus of this graduate level class will be on \"WHAT\" information is acquired using modern measurement tools in Chemistry, less on the \"HOW\" the measurements work, and the importance of effective visualization with the help of modern software for the purpose of communication.

How did certain spaces develop over time to suit the city's changing needs? How were canons of aesthetics formed and integrated into the city-state's fabric? In this course, we will also survey Athenian funerary and festival practices, discuss cultural institutions like the theater and the gymnasium, and examine how Athenian gender norms were reflected in material culture.

We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clanged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of main Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust. Class materials will be comprised of articles and book chapters to provide the historical, cultural, and political context of the eras we will discuss, and of essays, short stories, and poems translated from Yiddish to English.

Yet as this crucial debate around the ethics of pedagogy has grown, there has been no robust discussion about how we treat these same works in research contexts. What does it mean to feel morally conflicted about picking a novel, theorist, film or image for a class, but less so when it comes to analyzing that same material in an article or talk? As scholars, why do we want our object to be \"good\" all the time?\nThis is a class about what happens when good scholars study bad things, highlighting how this practice has always been a key part of critique. It is often by running up against critical thought that a media work becomes \"ethical\" or \"unethical\" in the first place. Moreover, the question of how to engage with \"unethical media\" motivates a whole array of critical argumentative comportments - it shows us how to canonize, how to excuse, how to elevate, how to politicize, how to aestheticize, how to love or hate - and in this way the question of ethics helps us to assume the identity of a scholar. To gain perspective on this process, our class will look at the intersection of contemporary theory and moral philosophy, along with films, photographs, graphic novels and radio dramas that try to deal morally with issues of aesthetic distance, visual violence, cancel culture, scholarly privilege, disgrace, eco-pessimism, and the ethical representation of sexuality, gender expression and race.\nTexts change a little from year to year.

growth). The first three weeks cover aspects of general microeconomics that everyone should know, including how the market system works, how prices are determined, why shortages and surpluses occur, and basic industrial competition. Topics include: supply and demand, competition versus monopoly, comparative advantage in trade, taxation, and market failures. The last two-thirds of the class build on these tools to study the behavior of the economy as a whole, particularly in an international context. Topics include: inflation, unemployment, recessions, booms, fiscal and monetary policy, budget deficits, economic development of nations, international trade, and exchange rates."],["Registration Requirements","Two years of high school mathematics.

Informally, economics helps us understand how household, business and government decision makers respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of government in alleviating various market failures. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets. Picking up where macroeconomics left off, this course will introduce the principles of microeconomics and teach you how to apply these concepts to real world scenarios.

How is inflation related to economic fluctuations? Why are fluctuations larger in developing economies than in developed economies? To understand the facts that we will document, we will consider modern general equilibrium theories of aggregate fluctuations. One important class of theories, Real Business Cycle theory, stresses the role of fluctuations in the rate of technology change. A different class of theories stresses the role of fluctuations in aggregate demand, including self-fulfilling changes in consumers' expectations.

In the year of the pandemic, European nations voted for strict vaccine export control measures, effectively slowing down access to medications for the Global South. Phrases like \"vaccine nationalism\" as well as \"vaccine passports\" have become commonplace. This twilight zone of deepening crises, and the imperial paranoid imaginary of what Neel Ahuja calls \"bioinsecurities,\" have long been represented by science fiction authors. Keeping a firm eye on epidemiology, race, and imperialism, this course charts a path along genre-bending, speculative fictions that imagine contagion and infection not just as disease but as racialized others from the late-nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. Contagion emerges not just as a moral panic or embodied paranoia about infection, but as a method of relationality that draws tightly controlled, governmentalized worlds around raced and differentiated bodies. We will think about how these fictional netherworlds produce new subjectivities of life, death, and living death. Alongside science fictional as well as speculative novels, spanning postcolonial, British as well as multiethnic US writing, we will also watch films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Night of the Living Dead, District 9, Arrival. But that's not the only agenda for this course: on the way, we will simultaneously encounter SF that offers us important insights on the question of race and empire more broadly, i.e. narratives that don't necessarily take contagion as their point of departure but are key in understanding racialization and the postcolony. Similarly, while the course is largely organized around science fiction, we will also ask what it might mean to think about speculative fiction or realism alongside SF. Thus, we will encounter texts that are thinking more abstractly about difference in order to understand different registers of SF."],["Class Materials (Required)","Required Texts: H,G, Wells, The War of the Worlds (Edward Gorey edition)\nAmitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome Ling Ma, Severance Victor LaValle, The Destroyer"]]},{"i":"024791-24","r":[{"n":"Katharine Helen Breen"}],"t":"College Seminar","k":"Monsters","u":"ENGLISH","n":"101-7","s":"24","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","The English word monster is derived from Latin words meaning ‘to demonstrate' and ‘to warn.'

The persistence of epic through cultural and linguistic change is one of the form's central themes: how can words heroically uttered and deeds heroically dared be passed on from one lifetime to those that follow? How are they transformed? What does it mean to take up as one's own something that has been passed down from a culture no longer present? Such questions become even more pressing in moments when one culture encounters another and in its new context must confront what to retain, what to adopt, and what to invent.

In the early nineteenth century, murder and other forms of gothic violence were often confined to remote castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the explosion of detective stories and crime fiction, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded both the supposedly blissful domestic scene and the modern city. Writers started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about which deaths are considered \"grievable.\" Increasingly, authors depicted amateur detectives who were skeptical of the social and legal order they were reestablishing through their work. Beginning with founders of the genre Edgar Allen Poe and Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), this course follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled tales, mid-century psychological thrillers by Patricia Highsmith, and recent detective fiction by Walter Mosley. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, we will conclude with a survey of twenty-first-century chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins and others.

In addition to excavating the long histories and present problems surrounding medical racism, another goal of this course is tracking the medicalization of race itself. As such, we will challenge commonly held perceptions of bodies, pain, ability, and the constitution of equitable futures. We will also supplement our reading with guest lectures from medical professionals working at the intersection of race and medicine. Students will take away from the class a deeper grasp of the discourse surrounding race and medicine, as well as how to deploy this knowledge in their critical interpretations of cultural production. Some conceptual questions for consideration include the following: how do texts by writers of color challenge normative assessments of what constitutes health and wellness? How do we ethically consider race and medicine without resorting to postracial idealism?

Despite nearly three decades of negotiations, the world is unlikely to avoid devastating impacts from climate change, where average global temperature increases will exceed the 2oC goal and is nearing well over 3oC. What, then, do COPs achieve? What role do they play in addressing global climate change? What role does science, business, technology, solidarity movements, and civil society play in shaping the global politics of climate change, and there with the potential to address climate change?

The government responded both by beginning to produce a wealth of knowledge about the city through practices of cartography, policing, and other forms of surveillance, and through policies of urban planning intended to enable the free circulation of capital and military forces through the streets. In this course, we will interrogate the relationship of literature and film to these forms of state knowledge production about the city of Paris across the 19th century and in the period from 1945 to the present. To what extent did representations of the city in modern and contemporary literature and film align with the state project of mapping the city and its inhabitants? How did literature function as a space of contestation of the modernization of the city, both through modeling non-normative practices of the use of urban space and in memorializing the spaces and communities impacted by state violence? How have literature and film participated in the struggle over who belongs in Paris, especially around questions of class and race? Authors and directors studied include Gaboriau, Baudelaire, Maspero, and Diop, along with archival documents and shorter excerpts from authors like Balzac, Perec, and Varda.

On the other, they were often drawn from the lower classes of society, and from Brittany, a region of France that was itself a kind of colonized space, where residents mostly spoke Breton rather than French. The sailor was also closely associated with supposedly asocial behaviors: criminality, same-sex sexuality, rampant non-monogamous heterosexuality, and interracial relationships. In this class, we will explore these paradoxes of the figure of the sailor in French literature and film of the 19th and 20th centuries, through the works of Jules Verne, Pierre Loti, Jean Epstein, Ousmane Sembène, and R.

In the U.S., these narrow stereotypes are just a few of the ways Black bodies get defined. In this course, we will move beyond those restrictive stereotypes, guided by questions such as, \"How does culture define health?\", \"How does the food pipeline affect the health of certain bodies?\" and \"What does it mean to live in an obesogenic environment?\" In this course, we examine the connection between health, culture, food, and environment with a focus on what is silenced and what is loud when generating \"fixes\" for \"diseased\" bodies. Silence refers to the disregard and dismissiveness of the narratives and experiences around the oppressions attached to the health of certain bodies.

How does the power of Western psychiatry intersect with that of global media to reinforce reigning paradigms and imperatives for how suffering is to be understood, classified, and experienced? Conversely, what counter-narratives are being produced by artists and their communities? What role can the arts play in individual and collective forms of healing—or in exacerbating pain and grievance? What kinds of voices seem to have power, and which are neglected? Where is the line between cathartic and exploitative representation of trauma and mental illness?

Beginning in the 1990s with the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Berlin, the city quickly became home to cutting-edge DJs, party planners, club owners, and dancers, including notorious clubs like Tresor and Berghain. Coming together, they pioneered new ways to express oneself and connect with one another through music and dance. This course examines many aspects of this culture, from the unique genres of music and how DJs create music to the technology of sound, the experience of dancing and of clubs as spaces, and the politics of belonging, representation, and identity on the dance floor, in particular its complicated exchanges with Black communities and music in Chicago and Detroit, the birthplaces of this music.

Students will engage with the varied historical, socio-political, and artistic changes in German culture throughout the twentieth century, including the vibrant and provocative culture of the 1920s and early 1930s, with a focus on changing forms of gender identity (the \"New Woman\") and sexual subcultures (as in the film Cabaret). Further, students will examine the everyday and extraordinary history of German-Jews in Germany around the caesura of the Jewish genocide executed by the National Socialists. After examining the megalomaniacal plans that the Nazis made for Berlin, the class turns to the devastated city of 1945 and the divided city of the Cold War, where the conflict between \"East\" and \"West\" emerges in the \"concrete\" form of the Berlin Wall. The final weeks concentrate on the events surrounding the collapse of the Wall and the creation of the Berlin Republic. Students will also encounter the changing face of national culture in light of the migration of the so-called Turkish \"guest workers\" of the post-War years, particularly through the art of later generations of Turkish-German authors and filmmakers in Berlin. In addition to reading major works of 20th-century literature, students will engage with visual media, in particular film, photography, and other visual art, to acquire a sense of the breathtaking scope of change in the urban context peculiar to twentieth century Berlin.

We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clanged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of main Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust.

The only thing they have in common is that in each of the cases to be discussed, theater is not understood as supporting, illustrating, reflecting or replacing politics, but rather that the political must be sought on the level of forms and materials of representation. The fundamental distinction between Le and La Politique (Lacoue-Labarthe, Nancy, Mouffe and others), i.e. the political and politics or politics and the police (Rancière) in French theory of the past decades, which itself draws on German-speaking thinkers of the political such as Karl Marx, Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin and Hannah Arendt, is a prerequisite. We will examine plays from different centuries, literatures and theater contexts from the early modern period to contemporary script-based performance. Questions that will occupy us could include, among others: Coloniality and decolonialization (Shakespeare, Genet, Heiner Müller), political and police dramaturgy (Lessing, Foucault, Brecht/Weigel, A.H. Recke), the theater of capital punishment (Büchner, Derrida), theater and potentiality (Brecht, Benjamin, Heidegger, Agamben), and the (queer) feminist deconstruction of the masculine dispositif of drama and theater (Fleißer, S.

In the course of our discussions, we will map our respective positionalities vis-à-vis the study of feminist engagements, histories, and actors in the Sinophone. Throughout the quarter we will combine our engagement with primary and secondary sources to navigate questions like: How do we study feminisms within the remit of Chinese studies? What biases, legacies, and challenges do we need to contend with as scholars working (mostly) in the Anglophone outside of the Sinosphere? Who determines when and where Sinophone feminist engagements emerged? What disciplinary methodologies and tools do we have in our interdisciplinary toolbox that we can deploy as researchers and as teachers? We will be joined in this enterprise by two exciting and distinct cohorts both virtually and in person. A series of guest speakers based in the USA, Europe, mainland China, and Taiwan who, in their roles as scholars and activists, will help us probe the contested claims about the births and birthplaces of Chinese feminisms, to engage, critique, and discuss both conventional and alter/native approaches to studying and teaching Sinophone feminisms in the Anglophone. We will thus have the opportunity, to engage in a dialogue with scholars like Barbara Mittler, Wang Zheng, Jia Tan, and others. For each of these lectures, we will share a virtual synchronous classroom with fellow classmates in Heidelberg University, who will attend an intensive version of this course over Summer 2024, also taught by Professor Zamperini. Our learning will thus help us build a collective, transcultural, and global community of thinkers and researchers, one that helpfully will continue long after the end of our course at the end of the Fall quarter.

To do this, we will be reading the work of people like bell hooks and Patricia Hill Collins, Toni Morrison and Toni Cade Bambara, Jennifer Nash and Hortense Spillers, and more."]]}]},{"i":"021017","c":"WCAS","t":"Graduate Colloquium","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"401-0","s":[{"i":"021017-20","r":[{"n":"Marquis Bey West"}],"t":"Graduate Colloquium","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"401-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-343"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["NO DATA","NO DATA"]]}]},{"i":"015741","c":"WCAS","t":"Topics in Gender and Sexuality Studies","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"490-0","s":[{"i":"015741-25","r":[{"n":"Jeffrey A Masten"}],"t":"Topics in Gender and Sexuality Studies","k":"Queering the Crown","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"490-0","s":"25","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":5,"p":[["Overview of class","Queering the Crown: Marlowe and Shakespeare, Pre-texts and Afterlives\nThis course will simultaneously engage a set of methods within/around literary/performance studies and interrogate the transhistoricity of queerness.

This status recognizes the distinctive cultural and political heritage of Tibet but nonetheless affirms Tibet as an integral part of China. Tibet was \"Peacefully Liberated\" by the People's Liberation Army in 1950-1951. Previously, the Republican and Qing imperial states variously claimed sovereignty or suzerainty over Tibet. Many Tibetans, whether living in Tibet or abroad, contest the historical and moral legitimacy of this rule, or question the particular arrangements that govern the place of Tibet, Tibetan people, and Tibetan language and culture as part of China's mosaic of fifty-six ethnic groups. The Dalai Lama (a Buddhist spiritual leader), and foreign supporters as diverse as Bjork and Paris Hilton, have made \"Free Tibet\" a familiar slogan and social cause. Within China such sentiments are commonly viewed as a serious attack on national integrity. This course examines competing claims regarding the national status of Tibet in light of the historically complex cultural and political relationships between Tibet and China. We will focus on the specifics of 20th c. Chinese and Tibetan nationalisms and probe the nature of nations and nationalism generally.

Each trial combined elements of both formal law and public theater; through these trials, we'll examine the relationship between legal reasoning and storytelling.

What are the historical origins of South Asian diasporic communities in Africa, South-east Asia, Europe, and North America? How did South Asia's encounter with colonialism affect the migration of South Asians elsewhere? In this thematic survey, we will learn about the history of South Asians' migration from the nineteenth century to the present, with special emphasis on the historical inter-relatedness of migration, colonialism, and decolonization. Our cast of characters will range from soldiers and exiles to laborers and merchants. We will traverse a diverse array of geographies, ranging from Singapore and Fiji to Uganda and Britain. We will discover how South Asian communities in various parts of the world were made and unmade by colonial economic imperatives, often exploitative trans-oceanic labor networks, and colonial categories of social identification.

The themes linking both quarters are tensions regarding ethnic and national identity, shifts in gender ideals and family structure, and the effects of imperialist depredation. Modern China was forged by the Qing (1644-1911), the last imperial dynasty. Its achievements and travails continue to inform our present moment. Whether its massive territory, multi-ethnic society, complex economic and political relations with the \"West\" and the rest of Asia—and much more—key facets of contemporary China are rooted in the Qing. Formidable in warfare, the Qing created a multi-ethnic empire bound by Confucian culture, surging domestic and international commerce, and a potent imperial political structure and ideology. At the same time, millenarian and ethnic yearnings, foreign imperialism, and intellectual and political ferment threatened throughout the course of the dynasty to tear the empire apart. Topics to be explored include the Manchu conquest, the imperial state and its problematic relationship with the gentry elite, shifts in gender ideals and family structure, millenarian movements, commercial and industrial growth, intra-Asian connections, the lives of common people, foreign imperialism, US-China relations, early Chinese nationalism and feminism, human and state rights, and revolutionary radicalism.

Our bodies are important to us.They are also important to the institutions we are a part of, including our families, our schools, our jobs, and our country. They are all invested in keeping our bodies healthy and productive. However, the array of institutions interested in the value of our bodies often have additional incentives- our health is surrounded by a hoard of controversies: - Why do some people get better medical care than others? - How should the healthcare system be organized? - How do we balance the risks of new medical treatments with the benefits? -What makes the stigma associated with disease and disability so enduring? - What happens when no diagnosis can be made? This course offers conceptual tools and perspectives for answering these controversies. To do so it surveys a variety of topics related to the intersections of health, biomedicine, culture, and society. We will analyze the cultural meanings associated with health and illness; the political debates surrounding health care, medical knowledge production, and medical decision-making; and the structure of thesocial institutions that comprise the health care industry.

class","Course title: Civil Military Relations in Democratic Societies Democracies around the world require a military to defend their people, values and interests from enemies abroad and within. They require a military to help advance the national interest abroad. However, they also need a military that will not seek to undermine the freedoms and will of the people that make democratic governance possible. In other words, the military must be subordinate to elected leaders and not seek to build a coup. Civil-Military Relations describes the connections that civilian policymakers have with their country's armed forces. It is the boundaries between diplomacy and war. Civilians and their elected leaders should focus on making foreign policy while the military should focus on how to best defend the state. When in good balance, proper relations sustain a democracy as the will of the people, reflected through their elected leaders, prevail. When in poor balance, military leaders can overtake the government in the form of a coup. In this course, we will think about the role of a military in a democratic government and how democracies use their militaries to advance their interests abroad. In addition, we will think about how civilian leaders and military officers ought to interact with one another to sustain a democracy. Finally, students will apply the current theories and debates in civil-military relations to develop a research project of personal interest. By the end of the course, students will be able to contribute to discussions in the literature through asking and answering questions of their own. They will also be able to become critical consumers of academic literature and be able to communicate their findings to a general audience."]]},{"i":"016391-21","r":[{"n":"Gabriel Restrepo Parrado"}],"t":"Integrating Project Seminar","k":"Dystopia in the Americas or How not to Fall into D","u":"INTL_ST","n":"395-0","s":"21","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L05"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"SEM","a":6,"p":[["Overview of class","Course title: Dystopia in the Americas or How not to Fall into Despair Dystopia is everywhere. From Marvel movies to daily news predicting natural disasters in the upcoming decades due to human extractive activities, today we are constantly exposed to dire visions of the future. However, the word \"dystopia\" has been used to describe a sharp critique of the present while maintaining the principle of utopian hope, that is, the belief that we can live better and actually prevent catastrophe. Dystopias can be political, social, environmental, racial—among others—but they all have something in common: they express our anxieties stemming from our experience of the present. This course offers a transnational overview of different types of dystopias (ecological, political, racial, technological) in the Americas and promotes critical engagement with these narratives. We will explore movies, tv series, short stories, and artworks from Latin America-Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico—and the United States to understand how dystopias can articulate our deepest fears and anxieties, but also how, in critiquing the present, they might suggest alternatives to think outside our nightmares and envision better futures."]]}]},{"i":"017517","c":"WCAS","t":"Honors Seminar","u":"INTL_ST","n":"398-1","s":[{"i":"017517-1","r":[{"n":"J Michelle Molina","p":"847 4612620","a":"Crowe Hall, 4-142"}],"t":"Honors Seminar","u":"INTL_ST","n":"398-1","s":"1","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"l":["INTL_ST Sem Rm 201 - 2010 Sh"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"THE","a":10}]},{"i":"018558","c":"WCAS","t":"Introduction to Energy Systems for the 21st Century","u":"ISEN","n":"220-0","s":[{"i":"018558-20","r":[{"n":"Yip-Wah Chung"}],"t":"Introduction to Energy Systems for the 21st Century","u":"ISEN","n":"220-0","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G15"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":115,"o":"1"}]},{"i":"018557","c":"WCAS","t":"Topics in Contemporary Energy and Climate Change","u":"ISEN","n":"410-0","s":[{"i":"018557-20","r":[{"n":"Yarrow Larue Axford","a":"Technological Institute F394/F395","o":"axford@northwestern.edu"}],"t":"Topics in Contemporary Energy and Climate Change","u":"ISEN","n":"410-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Technological Institute F285"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration reserved for Graduate students in all disciplines or seniors majoring in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Math, EPS, Biol Anthro, Mat Sci, Chem Eng, Mech Eng, Civ Eng, Envir Eng, Envr Sci, or Electrical Eng."}]},{"i":"018835","c":"WCAS","t":"NUvention: Energy","u":"ISEN","n":"420-0","s":[{"i":"018835-20","r":[{"n":"Anne Marie Johlie"},{"n":"Ian Zachary Hoopes Wiese"}],"t":"NUvention: Energy","u":"ISEN","n":"420-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Ford ITW Auditorium 1350"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":30}]},{"i":"021075","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","u":"ISEN","n":"495-0","s":[{"i":"021075-1","r":[{"n":"Alexander James Polzin"}],"t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","k":"Land Use and Climate Change","u":"ISEN","n":"495-0","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Technological Institute M166"],"d":"2024-10-29","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":21}]},{"i":"003078","c":"WCAS","t":"Elementary Italian","u":"ITALIAN","n":"101-1","s":[{"i":"003078-20","r":[{"n":"Massimiliano Luca Delfino"}],"t":"Elementary Italian","u":"ITALIAN","n":"101-1","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 213"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":18,"p":[["Overview of class","A beginning course in Italian language and culture, Elementary Italian is devoted to developing all four language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) within the three modes of communication (interpersonal, interpretive, presentational).

Italian directors have drawn from their 'national' medieval literary tradition avoiding the fantasy genre typical of Hollywood. The Italian medieval film plays with realism, spiritualism, pauperism, comedy, sexual irreverence and political commentary. This course explores films by world-famous directors such as Roberto Rossellini, Federico Fellini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Liliana Cavani inspired by the Italian medieval literature, history and visual arts to consider, among other things, how the projection of the past served as a reflection on the difficult present of the nation."],["Class Materials (Required)","Films on NU reserves."]],"o":"6"}]},{"i":"003097","c":"WCAS","t":"Dante's Divine Comedy","u":"ITALIAN","n":"275-0","s":[{"i":"003097-20","r":[{"n":"Paola Nasti"}],"t":"Dante's Divine Comedy","k":"A Dream of Peace","u":"ITALIAN","n":"275-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Cent.

This course examines a selection of the Divine Comedy's cantos in their cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante fashioned the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible to craft his dream of universal peace. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Comedy and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation."],["Class Materials (Required)","Dante Alighieri, Divine Comedy, translated by Robert and Jean Hollander, edited by Robert Hollander, New York: Doubleday 2002. 2004, 2007.

We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clanged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of main Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust. Class materials will be comprised of articles and book chapters to provide the historical, cultural, and political context of the eras we will discuss, and of essays, short stories, and poems translated from Yiddish to English.

For that matter, what were the underlying mathematical concepts mentioned in the first place? This seminar will explore the use of mathematics in film and television.

This course will focus on discrete dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. We will start with the examples of the shift map, the tent map, and the logistic family to introduce the concept of chaos, and explore further properties of chaotic behaviors through Lyapunov exponents, conjugacy, and bifurcations. Additional topics to be covered include fractals, self-similar dimensions, complex dynamics, and an exploration of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. We will also make frequent use of computation technology to augment our understanding and inspire our mathematical investigations. The prerequisite of this course is a course in linear algebra.

And yet, no ancient city was so desired and feared, so admired and despised. Babylonian citizens saw their city as a paradise—the center of the world and symbol of cosmic harmony, while Greek historian Herodotus called it the world's most splendid city. But for the Jews, it was a city of sin and pride. For millennia, the city and the myth of Babylon have inspired artists, writers, and philosophers all over the world. In this course, we will explore the art, architecture, and urban history of Babylon from its foundations to the present day, as well as the artistic legacy of this ancient city in the modern world. We will survey the visual culture of Babylon in a variety of media from the miniature art of cylinder seals to the grandeur of its monuments like the Ishtar Gate. We will study the city's palaces, temples, and colossal walls as representations of imperial ideology, and inspiration for fantastic structures, like the Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens. In addition to the ancient artistic legacy of Babylon, we will consider the historical and cultural memory of the city in the modern world, through grand artistic depictions since the Renaissance, and visual representations in popular culture from films to video games to sci-fi and opera. Finally, we will examine how the city and its monumental buildings were instrumentalized by Saddam Hussein as symbols of nationalism and propaganda in the 1970s and ‘80s."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbook required."],["Class Notes","There is an internal waitlist for this class.

Among humans, \"sex,\" along with the nearby term \"gender,\" can also refer to cultural or social categories like woman, man, or nonbinary. And there is also \"sex\" in the sense of sexual orientation, a set of categories describing an individual's typical pattern of sexual attraction, such as lesbian, gay, straight, or bisexual. Needless to say, things get complicated pretty quickly. <paragraph break> In this seminar, we will read and discuss recent philosophical attempts to make sense of all this.

What is the best account of concepts like gender identity or sexual orientation? How (if at all) do those concepts relate to biological sex? What about the ethics and politics of sex?

It will familiarize the students with critically interpreting sources, anticipating and discussing objections, organizing and formulating the resulting position compellingly. At the conclusion of the course, the student should be able to know what it takes to write a successful research assignment not only in philosophy, but quite generally in academic contexts. As a PHILOSOPHY course, the students will learn the core ideals of major classics of democratic theory from Aristotle to Habermas in a historically guided systematic development of the normative ideal \"democratic state\". In this process, they will also learn to apply these (=our) ideals reflectively and critically on contemporary challenges to democratic practice like elite domination, racism and populism.

We want true premises to lead to true conclusions---that is, we want the truth of the conclusions to follow from the truth of the premises. When this happens, we say that the premises entail the conclusions. Logic examines this \"follows from\", or entailment, relation, and how to represent sentences in an idealized way that captures (at least some) of that relationship. Logic makes subtle mistakes easier to spot—and this is useful in philosophy where arguments can be quite intricate! The first step is learning how to represent sentences in natural language in a symbolic language, which allows for step-by-step reconstruction of natural language arguments. The second step is determining whether the argument, so represented, has features that mark it as an entailment. When it does, conclusions follow from premises! When it doesn't---either the conclusions don't follow, or we need to refine our formal representation of the argument. The course begins by examining truth-functional logic: a system for treating arguments involving \"and\", \"or\", \"not\", and \"if…then\" constructions. We'll then show how this logic is inadequate, but how its main shortcomings are met by first-order logic, which also accommodates arguments involving quantifier words like \"all\", \"none\", and \"some\"."],["Learning Objectives","Students in this course will learn: •To recognize deductively valid arguments and inferences, and to distinguish them from empirical, probabilistic inferences, as well as common invalid inference patterns. •To acknowledge the power and systematicity, but also the limitations of deductive reasoning, •To translate natural language sentences into a formal language that makes their logical structure—and so what follows from them—easier to see. •Develop step-by-step reconstructions of real world arguments that make their \"follows from\" structure apparent. •By modeling natural language arguments, students will see how a simple, abstract language reveals implicit aspects of everyday arguments. As such they will appreciate the value of applying similar formal constructs to a range of different problems •\tTo present arguments, in clear and standard logical notation."],["Class Materials (Required)","All class materials will be available on Canvas at NO cost to the student."],["Class Materials (Suggested)","Forall x: Calgary, by Magnus, Button, Zach, et al."],["Class Notes","FInal exam in class"]],"o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-60","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"60","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G32"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-61","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"61","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-420"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-62","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"62","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-430"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-63","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"63","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L06"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-64","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"64","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L06"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-65","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"65","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L06"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-66","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"66","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 110"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"}]},{"i":"002602","c":"WCAS","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":[{"i":"002602-20","r":[{"n":"Claudia Yau"}],"t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Fisk Hall 217"],"d":"2024-09-24","e":"2024-12-07","c":"LEC","a":100,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration restricted to Undergraduate students only","p":[["Overview of class","How can we make our lives and our communities better?

Central questions discussed herein include very common philosophical questions such as: \"What does it mean to be a human being?\"; \"how do we account for the past (or time, more generally)?\"; and \"how is knowledge about ourselves—as thinking subjects—possible?\" However, what makes these questions unique to Africana philosophy is their being asked in light of Western modernity, colonialism, and slavery by or about African-descended people. This is so since, as Louis Gordon tells us, \"there was no reason for the people of the African continent to have considered themselves as Africans until that identity was imposed upon them through conquest and colonization.\" So the question: \"What does it mean to be a human being?\" is raised in light of the humanity of African descended peoples that was called into question beginning with Western modernity, colonialism, and slavery.

With close to 2 million people under the control of the American criminal legal system, the United States has more total people who are incarcerated than any other country in the world. Moreover, the United States has one of the most punitive approaches to criminal justice, imposing lengthy prison sentences, forcing people who are incarcerated to spend years—sometimes even decades—in solitary confinement, and providing very few educational, vocational, and recreational programs in prisons. Punishment and incarceration also disproportionately impact people of color. Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites. While Black Americans and Hispanics make up about 32% of the US population, they constitute 56% of the incarcerated population. This course will use a philosophical lens to examine the causes and consequences of this crisis of mass incarceration in the United States, along with possible solutions to it, with a particular emphasis on the theories of punishment grounding our criminal legal system and, thus, our prisons. The course will include students from the Evanston campus and incarcerated students in the Northwestern Prison Education Program. *Note: This course will take place inside Sheridan Correctional Center in Sheridan, IL. On class days, students will leave Evanston at 8 AM and will return by 3:30 PM. Enrollment is limited to 10 students from Evanston, is by permission only, and requires an application.

These reports should be submitted the day the reading is due and will be graded on a 4-point scale, with 4 as excellent, 3 as good, 2 as adequate, 1 as deficient (or late), and N/C as not deserving of credit.

With close to 2 million people under the control of the American criminal legal system, the United States has more total people who are incarcerated than any other country in the world. Moreover, the United States has one of the most punitive approaches to criminal justice, imposing lengthy prison sentences, forcing people who are incarcerated to spend years—sometimes even decades—in solitary confinement, and providing very few educational, vocational, and recreational programs in prisons. Punishment and incarceration also disproportionately impact people of color. Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites. While Black Americans and Hispanics make up about 32% of the US population, they constitute 56% of the incarcerated population. This course will use a philosophical lens to examine the causes and consequences of this crisis of mass incarceration in the United States, along with possible solutions to it, with a particular emphasis on the theories of punishment grounding our criminal legal system and, thus, our prisons. The course will include students from the Evanston campus and incarcerated students in the Northwestern Prison Education Program. *Note: This course will take place inside Sheridan Correctional Center in Sheridan, IL. On class days, students will leave Evanston at 8 AM and will return by 3:30 PM. Enrollment is limited to 10 students from Evanston, is by permission only, and requires an application. In no more than 500 words each, please respond to the following two questions:\nWhat do you think you would contribute to a class of this kind?\nWhat do you think you would gain from a class of this kind?\nPlease submit responses to Professor Jennifer Lackey at j-lackey@northwestern.edu by May 31, 2024. Admissions decisions will be made by June 10th."],["Learning Objectives","To understand competing theories of punishment and to assess whether any support the criminal legal system in the United States.\nTo evaluate the causes and consequences of the crisis of mass incarceration in the United States. To be able to identify the connections between incarceration, race, and poverty. To collaborate with other students in the course and to combine scholarship on punishment and incarceration with the firsthand experience that NPEP students have with these phenomena.\nTo develop solutions to the crisis of mass incarceration, both theoretical and practical."],["Evaluation Method","Course Work: Students are required to write reading reports of each class period's reading assignments, which should have two distinct components and should be no more than 1½ pages total per class: (1) a summary of the current class's readings (which will typically include two or three readings), and (2) a critique of, or reflection on, the arguments/ideas. These reports should be submitted the day the reading is due and will be graded on a 4-point scale, with 4 as excellent, 3 as good, 2 as adequate, 1 as deficient (or late), and N/C as not deserving of credit.

It is intended for students who have had zero physics experience. Enrollment for this section is by permission number for this reason. This is the first quarter of a three-quarter, algebra-based physics course with lecture. Physics is the most basic of the sciences, dealing with the behavior and structure of matter. Lectures illustrate physical principles: mechanics, motion, momentum and energy, fluids, and oscillations. It continues as PHYSICS 130-2, 3. Students taking this course must also enroll in a Physics Lab 136-1. Actual demonstrations of many physical principles will be shown in the lecture whenever possible. Weekly quizzes emphasize problem solving. The goal of the course is for the student to gain an understanding of the nature of the physical principles which govern the world around us and the universe beyond, through models which draw on our everyday experiences. Topics: 1. Motion in One Dimension 2. Vectors 3. Motion in a Plane 4. Particle Dynamics 5. Work and Energy 6. Conservation of Energy 7. Conservation of Linear Momentum 8. Collisions 9.

In the 2020 election former Vice President Joe Biden soundly defeated incumbent president Donal Trump in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. Trump, lying about the voter fraud he claims occurred, has not concede the election. In 2016 polls showed Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote yet Donald Trump emerged victorious in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. In 2008 America elected its first African American President, Barack Obama and reelected him in 2012. In 2000 George W. Bush also lost the popular vote but he was ultimately chosen the victor by the Supreme Court. The fallout from the recount and the Supreme Court decision that gave Bush the victory is still being debated and studied. This class will examine presidential elections and how they have evolved since 1952, the first year TV advertising began to have impact on the races. This class will challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the \"YouTube\" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense \"ground game\" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages and finding a willing press that was at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage. In 2020 the country was literally plagued with a horrible pandemic, economic collapse and a reckoning regarding racial injustice."],["Learning Objectives","There are several learning goals for this class. The first is to give you a historical context for how the modern presidential campaign has evolved from 1952 to the present day. The second is to show you how candidates and the press interact in ways that shape press and social media coverage of a candidate or issue. The first two goals are meant to help achieve the third goal, which is to help you become more critical consumers of both campaigns and the media. If you are planning to go into politics or journalism this class is also meant to give the necessary background for creating new ideas for using the tools of those two careers. Your writing assignments are designed for you to clearly articulate those new ideas or reflect on previous campaigns."],["Evaluation Method","Your grade will be determined by a two-to-three page, 800-1,000- word Op-Ed article (45%), a 10-12 page, double spaced, term paper (45%), and your class participation (10%).

Severe and racialized polarization divides our two major political coalitions. Some of the wealthiest and most powerful corporations and individuals fuel and benefit from our divisions, and their interplay has fueled gridlock, corruption, and dysfunction in Washington - which in turn has increased the public's appetite for more authoritarian leadership. Disinformation is rampant. Americans can't agree on basic truths like whether Joe Biden was legitimately elected in 2020 - even as attacks on nonpartisan election administration and the right to vote are accelerating in the run-up to the 2024 election. Americans today have historically low levels of trust in one another, in our government, and in our democratic system. Addressing these challenges, renewing our democracy, and building a healthier political culture will require a range of efforts. Social movements and grassroots activists have an essential role to play - in concert with high-integrity politicians and public officials, journalists, technologists, business and philanthropic leaders, and others.

We will explore the role of state mental hospitals in the U.S. in the early to mid-20th century, and we will examine the political forces that drove the de-institutionalization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, with additional consideration of the contemporary implications of the closing of state hospitals. Finally, the course will focus on the evolution of psychotherapy in the modern marketplace, and some of the challenges posed by the demands of the health insurance industry and academic research. The aggressive way in which the DSM has been marketed internationally and the implications of culture for diagnosis will also be discussed. Along the way, we will explore critiques of the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance industry, and modern psychiatry.

MLM goes by other names as well, such as hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), mixed effects models, random coefficient modeling, and random effects models. These techniques have been applied to many different research questions within the biomedical, behavioral, social sciences, and even engineering. We will focus on MLM as it is used in behavioral and social science research, with examples from education, lifespan development, and emotion research. Specifically, we will discuss in detail the three main types of multilevel models that are used in the social sciences: 1) the clustered-observations or organizational models (e.g., children nested within classrooms), 2) growth-curve or traejctory models (e.g., estimation of change with measurements nested within people over months or years), and 3) within-person variation models (daily or hourly measurements nested within people over days or weeks).

How do saintly people interact with their bodies? What do modern celebrities like Beyonce and Tupac Shakur have in common with the saints? Why is there a patron saint of stomachaches? This course explores the complex relationship between saints and their bodies in Christian history. Saints have long represented the extremes of Christian excellence, in large part because their lives and bodies interrogate the boundaries between heaven and earth, spirit and flesh, masculine and feminine, holy and transgressive, life and death. Saints facilitate incredible miracles, perform painful and sometimes disgusting acts of asceticism, and experience mystically erotic relationships with the divine. Even as saints live to deny their bodies, their bodies are nevertheless foundational to their sanctity, both before and after death. In this class, we will explore how and why certain exceptional individuals came to be regarded as saints; the ways in which the body was central to living a saintly life and maintaining a connection to the world after death; how religious communities developed around saints and the body; how saints used their bodies to serve their broader communities; and how ideas about sainthood, sanctity, and the body developed in relation to changing cultural movements, social interests, and local ideals.

Do we set out to mold reality to our vision or accept it as it is? How do we forge ahead with our dreams if others do not share our values or goals? Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward. We will read the novel in English; no prior knowledge of Spanish or Spanish literature is needed."],["Class Materials (Required)","Cervantes, Miguel de. Don Quixote. Trans. Edith Grossman.
