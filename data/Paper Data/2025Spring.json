Writers of fiction, poetry, and theater have long been interested in exploring musical experience, and readers of many backgrounds have a great deal to learn from them about music. The course is articulated around a weekly series of thematically-related readings drawn from several literary genres: short stories such as \"Wunderkind\" by Carson McCullers, biographical fiction such as Josef Skvorecky's Dvorak in Love and Klaus Mann's Pathetic Symphony, jazz-related fiction in works by Dorothy Baker (Young Man with a Horn) and James Baldwin (Another Country), poetry by writers from Shakespeare and John Dryden to Frank O'Hara and Adrienne Rich, and plays by Alexander Pushkin (Mozart and Salieri), Peter Shaffer (Amadeus), Clifford Odets (Golden Boy), Itamar Moses (Bach at Leipzig). While the course will have limited space for full-length novels, excerpts from longer works are sure to be included, such as Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain and Doktor Faustus, and Willa Cather's The Song of the Lark.

In this course we will review the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in the last forty years and apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire. This combination of theoretical inquiry and practical application of analytical methods is reflected in the course design, in which in-class discussion of readings will be followed by analytical exercises. The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussions, one presentation and two analytical papers."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the class the student will be expected to have become familiar with the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in recent decades and learned how to apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbooks required."]]}]},{"i":"003733","c":"MUSIC","t":"Selected Topics in Music Theory","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"435-0","s":[{"i":"003733-1","r":[{"n":"Richard Ashley","p":"847/491-5720","a":"r-ashley@northwestern.edu","o":"W 10-11 and by appt."}],"t":"Selected Topics in Music Theory","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"435-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA 1-168"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":10,"p":[["Overview of class","This class engages Brahms late piano works (Opp. 116-119) both for their own sake structurally and aesthetically and as a vehicle for understanding the analysis of 19th century chromatic music.

This course is designed to offer an introduction to a variety of legal issues that are commonly encountered by lawyers and their clients operating on the international scene. Topics include international contracts of sale (extending to contracts of transportation and letters of credit, the most important way in which international contracts of sale are financed); import and export regulations; agency, distributorship, franchising, and intellectual property licensing agreements; foreign direct investment (extending to the legal regulation of corruption); dispute resolution (covering arbitration and litigation); and corporate social responsibility. Relevant law includes US law; multilateral treaties such as the Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG); and regional agreements such as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, formerly known as NAFTA). There are no prerequisites; in particular, no prior knowledge of business law or of international law is assumed. The course begins on Monday, 13 January 2025 and ends on Wednesday, 12 March 2025.

The course will explore practical and ethical issues faced by public interest lawyers and the challenges of enforcing legal rights of low-income clients. In addition to the weekly seminar, students spend 12 hours per week in an approved externship with a non-profit public interest organization doing civil legal work. Students work under the supervision of attorneys in these offices and conduct research, write briefs and memoranda, interview clients and witnesses, participate in community education efforts, and assist attorneys in trial preparation and trial. Students secure their own placement in consultation with the faculty member before the semester starts."],["Learning Objectives","Ideally, if you participate fully and actively in the Public Interest Practicum, you will: (1) Expand your knowledge in particular areas of substantive law, including: the particular areas of law covered at your externship (e.g. employment discrimination), the scarcity of legal services for the poor, the range of legal issues faced by low-income persons, important topics such as race and trauma, and issues in professional responsibility; (2) Improve on a variety of skills: legal (depending on placement and including research, writing, analysis, fact gathering, interviewing, identifying causes of action, case strategy, drafting, and oral advocacy and presentation) and other professional skills (including receiving and understanding assignments, figuring out how to prioritize work, time management, meeting deadlines, learning from feedback, and communication with supervisors); (3) Gain a better understanding of yourself (by identifying successes and areas for improvement and starting to develop and apply new strategies through self-reflection in journals, class discussions, and meetings with supervisors and faculty); and (4) Explore and start planning for who you want to be as a lawyer doing what and where."],["Evaluation Method","The final grade will be based on approximately these components and the more detailed descriptions that follow: (1) 20% 1st journal installment; (2) 20% 2nd journal installment; (3) 10% journal on which you do the best; (4) 25% class workshop; and (5) 25% class attendance and participation. You will write reflective journal entries analyzing your work experiences and different class topics and responding to prompts. You will submit your journal two times over the course of the semester. After you hand in the 1st journal installment, I will provide you with feedback to help you improve on your 2nd journal installment. You will give a workshop to the class on a topic of your choosing towards the end of the semester. As part of the workshop, you will present your research on that particular topic in an engaging, interactive way and facilitate a brief discussion. Class attendance and participation will be graded based on efforts, not on whether answers are right or wrong. In addition, successful compliance with the externship requirements and the expectations of your placement supervisor are essential. Although the field placement experience will not be graded directly, I will be in contact with your supervisor during the semester to discuss your work. Failure to comply with the requirements and expectations of your externship may have an impact on your grade. You will get individual feedback and guidance from me on your journals, workshop topic and outline, and anything else that relates to the class through conferences during the semester, and you can meet with me more, as needed."],["Class Materials (Required)","All course materials will be provided on Canvas.

Not only does foreign law matter to US lawyers in international business transactions or international dispute resolution, but it is important within national law (consider Chicago litigation involving a contract governed by French law or a Miami resident bequeathing real estate in Italy). Indeed, a comprehensive ABA survey reveals that after 7 years of practice, 44% of US lawyers report work involving foreign law, a figure that reaches 66% for lawyers in large firms and 65% for those working as inside counsel. However, the \"handling\" of foreign law raises formidable challenges. Is meaningful interpretation of foreign law even possible for a US lawyer? How to optimize one's understanding of foreign law? Are there methods, techniques, or strategies that can overcome differences across laws, languages, and cultures - that can give reliable access to foreign law's singularity? How best to proceed, and what can be achieved? Specifically, is foreign law translatable? Meanwhile, many claim that US courts can rely on foreign law in adjudication. Is foreign law legitimate normative authority in the United States? Note that this course, despite its focus, finds itself effectively ranging beyond the issue of foreign law. Indeed, many of the insights derived from an examination of the hurdles attendant upon foreign-law interaction also prove useful in situations involving national law only. Examples and case-studies draw on business law and constitutional law broadly understood. There are no prerequisites; in particular, no prior knowledge of foreign law or of a foreign language is assumed. The course begins on Monday, 13 January 2025 and ends on Wednesday, 12 March 2025.

The course is not intended to teach you how to draft any particular type of contract (e.g., employment agreements, asset purchase agreements, limited liability company operating agreements), but rather to introduce you to the basic contract concepts and organizational structure that most negotiated commercial contracts share, as well as give you practice spotting issues in contracts drafted by others. Although you will be exposed to, and work with, existing agreements relating to previous deals and other types of contract \"precedent,\" the focus of the course will be on teaching original contemporary contract drafting. You will be taught how to draft agreements in a formal, but modern, style free of archaic language, redundancies, and legalese."],["Registration Requirements","Contracts is a helpful course to have taken, but is not required. International students should not shy away from this course just because they have not taken Contracts."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the course, you will be able to identify the various components of a typical negotiated contract and understand their different purposes. You will learn how to properly use contract concepts such as covenants, conditions, representations and warranties, grants of discretionary authority, and declarations to convey the intentions of the parties. You will learn how to draft clearly and unambiguously in a contemporary style that avoids formal and archaic terms and expressions and is easy for the reader to understand. You will learn how to add value to transactions by spotting substantive issues in contracts drafted by others."],["Evaluation Method","55% final drafting assignment; 35% weekly drafting assignments (cumulative); 10% professionalism."],["Class Materials (Required)","Tina L.

Some sessions will be devoted entirely to an exercise, and a few will be substantially lecture, but most class sessions will begin with me talking about the topic of the day and us discussing some examples together, followed by you working on a problem involving some aspect of the topic. There will be a relatively short written assignment due most weeks except at the very beginning and end of the semester. You will receive feedback on each assignment, and they will serve as building blocks for the final assignment (due at the beginning of the exam period), which will require you to draft a complete contract. You will be drafting parts of this contract for the first time, but much of it will be a re-write of the earlier assignments. All graded work will be done individually. Although, because of its size and subject matter, the course is not subject to a mandatory curve, typically there will be a range of grades roughly in line with the Law School's grade distribution policy for upper-level doctrinal exam courses with more than twelve students (i.e., a mean of 3.5-3.6 with a target of 3.55)."]]},{"i":"016304-2","r":[{"n":"Judy Rosenbaum","p":"312/503-8943","a":"McCormick 194","o":"TBD, though always available by appointment"}],"t":"Basics of Contract Drafting","u":"LAWSTUDY","n":"622","s":"2","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":20}],"l":["Rubloff Building 254 -

Class sessions will involve both a lecture presentation from a faculty member on a discovery topic, and a breakout session in which students will gain experience in drafting discovery requests and responses, taking and defending mock depositions, and preparing and arguing motions on issues that litigators regularly confront, such as on electronic discovery preservation and document production. The breakout sessions will be taught by the group of adjuncts and they will rotate throughout the semester. Each student will be designated an \"\"A\"\" or a \"\"B\"\" for the purposes of the assignments. You will retain your designation for the entire semester. The exercise for this class will be drawn from the Taylor v Pinnacle Packaging case file. Students designated as \"\"A's\"\" will always represent Taylor. Students designated as \"\"B's\"\" will always represent Pinnacle Packaging.

Tax money meant for the poor is pocketed by the people entrusted to help. In each case, investigative reporting has played an essential role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing and exposing corruption at the highest levels. In this dynamic course grounded in real-time investigative reporting, students will expose a problem of significant national or international importance and chronicle its effects on the lives and livelihoods of those most impacted, particularly those in disenfranchised communities. Throughout the winter and spring quarters, students will take on one critical subject using the tools honed by investigative reporters: documents, data and sources. Students will dig deep and learn on the go, reporting on a complicated topic, synthesizing findings and writing or producing a compelling, long-form investigative story suitable for publication. In the past six months, students at the Medill Investigative Lab have published more than 15 stories in The Washington Post, focused on the impact of COVID-19 in America's nursing homes. The stories have prompted calls for investigations by members of Congress. The winter course is a primer: Working remotely, students will devote a tremendous amount of time digging for information and framing stories. In the spring, students will report out stories on the ground, traveling when necessary and if possible. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students; students will work as a team and with the professor to report, write and produce stories.

It moves chronologically from early Islam to the twentieth century, tracing its evolution across various regions, including the Middle East, West, North, and East Africa, and the Indian Ocean world. It connects practices of enslavement in the Islamic world over time to global slaving practices, which have existed since the outset of ancient human societies. Key topics include the roles of slaves in Islamic societies, such as soldiers, concubines, and administrators, and the diverse experiences of enslaved men, women, and children. Students will investigate slave trading networks, including the Trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean trades, and explore how slavery intersected with race, gender, and class stratification, as well as imperial expansion. The course also addresses colonial interventions, abolition movements, and the legacies of slavery in contemporary Muslim societies. Using a range of primary sources, scholarly texts, literature, and mixed-media, students will critically engage with the historical narratives and debates surrounding slavery in the Islamic world. By the end of the course, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the varied forms of slavery (or slaveries) in Islamic societies and their impact on cultural, political, and social history. <p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li> Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li> Open for cross-registration</li>\n<li> Open for Sophomores and above</li>\n</ul>"]]}]},{"i":"021453","c":"DOHA","t":"Media and Society","u":"INTERDIS","n":"201-0","s":[{"i":"021453-70","r":[{"n":"Banu Akdenizli"}],"t":"Media and Society","u":"INTERDIS","n":"201-0","s":"70","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":6,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":7,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room G-200"],"d":"2025-01-07","e":"2025-04-24","c":"LEC","a":54,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Seats are reserved for Freshmen Only"},{"i":"021453-71","r":[{"n":"Shehram Mokhtar"}],"t":"Media and Society","u":"INTERDIS","n":"201-0","s":"71","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":8,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":15}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room G-200"],"d":"2025-01-07","e":"2025-04-24","c":"LEC","a":54,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Seats are reserved for Freshmen Only"}]},{"i":"021857","c":"DOHA","t":"Interdisciplinary Topics Course","u":"INTERDIS","n":"202-0","s":[{"i":"021857-70","r":[{"n":"Heather Jaber"}],"t":"Interdisciplinary Topics Course","k":"Digital Media Ethics","u":"INTERDIS","n":"202-0","s":"70","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":6,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":7,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 2-227"],"d":"2025-01-07","e":"2025-04-24","c":"LEC","a":22,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Seats are reserved for Sophomore and Freshmen only.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>Should holograms of Umm Kulthum or Michael Jackson be giving concerts?

We will investigate several questions, such as: How do we consider charges against public decency, family values, and morality, which shape online controversies in the Global South and the MENA region? What is the place of scandal or the sacred in the realm of the digital? What forms of invisible labor shape our relationship to social media? What are the mechanics of surveillance and how do they relate to persisting global power asymmetries? What is the role of technology corporations in shaping our digital media landscape, considering an increasing reliance on digital media to help us navigate the world and even tell us about our own bodies? This course explores locally situated questions of ethics, considering their tension with ideas of the universal. It also examines the role of states, technology platforms, and corporations in shaping these landscapes of acceptability.

The present course is being developed in real time during the Israel-Hamas war of October 2023. Widespread and commonly expressed perceptions and analyses posit that mainstream media coverage of the conflict produced in the West is suffused with - and frequently overtaken by - narratives that support the interests of Israel and U.S. policy. Consequently, Palestinian human rights and humanity are diminished if not omitted altogether from mainstream media coverage to harmful effect on Palestinians living under Israeli occupation as well as in diaspora communities, and by extension to Arabs and Muslims around the world. Effects of media coverage also impact Israelis and their supporters. The course focuses on reported news coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict using tools of media literacy including theory and framing of news, Global South perspectives on Palestine, case studies of Western media coverage, biases of omission resulting in decontextualized coverage, data analysis, the roles of empathy and fact-checking in news production, and the divide between fact and opinion.

To better understand the persistent power and appeal of these media, this course will sample the range of questions and answers—or theories—of the moving image from the 1910s to today. The course will engage with often difficult texts to understand their arguments and their implications for our contemporary media landscape. Each week will focus on a theme and discuss no more than two essays. Assessments will be based on short posts and either several brief papers or one longer essay. By the end of the course, students will be able to 1) identify key theories and theorists of moving-image media; 2) describe the main arguments and ideas of any given essay; 3) apply those arguments or ideas to contemporary examples of either films, television programs, or trends. </p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: MIT 220-0</li>\n<li>Open to Sophomores and above </li>\n<li>MIT 312 History of Film is helpful, but not required</li>\n</ul>"]]},{"i":"021968-83","r":[{"n":"Christina Paschyn"}],"t":"Undergraduate Seminar","k":"Science and Health Journalism","u":"MIT","n":"398-0","s":"83","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":2,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":3,"m":15}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 1-245"],"d":"2025-01-07","e":"2025-04-24","c":"LEC","a":11,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for sophomore, juniors, and seniors only.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>The Science and Health Journalism course seeks to provide students with the intellectual tools and practical skills to engage critically and report these two subjects as part of their news beats.

The first thread, the art of play, focuses on the history and development of Viola Spolin's foundational and ubiquitous theatre games, and their surprising grounding in the early academic studies of play by Neva Boyd, NU Faculty from 1927-1941, who was an early proponent of the importance of play and its academic study, and Spolin's mentor. The second thread, the science of play, is a look at the child's ontological development of play skills, informed by Piagetian and modern insights, with a focus on how play drives communication development. In the second half of the course, we bring the two threads together, as students collaboratively engage in and reflect on the art and science of Spolin's games.

Familiarization and practice with technology-assisted treatment approaches, and the incorporation of guided biofeedback will be provided. Principles of motor learning will inform the students' selection of swallowing rehabilitation approaches as they engage in real world cases of patients with dysphagia resulting from neurological disorders, head and neck cancers, pulmonary diseases, and aging. Synthesis of acquired knowledge, skills, and clinical decision making will be assessed through the development of assessment and treatment reports including quantification and classification of dysphagia severity, development of prognostic statements, oral intake and diet consistency recommendations, selection of appropriate intervention approaches. Applied practice in formulation of treatment goals will be conducted using real-word patient cases, with consideration for clinical and environmental patient conditions, dysphagia severity, ethics, cultural diversity, and socioeconomic factors.

Moving historically, roughly decade by decade from the 1960s to the present, the main task of the class will be to consider the difference digital computational technologies make in the creation of aesthetic forms and the experience of them. For instance, what new forms and modes of experience become possible with computers? What exactly makes something \"digital\"? And how can we tell (or not) -- and does it matter at all -- if something was made with the aid of automated processes? And finally, how do the answers to these questions change as we move from one computational era to another, e.g. from the mainframe and hobbyist eras to the domestic reception of popular electronics and computers in the 1980s to the emergence of the World Wide Web and social media and smartphones in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s up to and possibly beyond our historical present.

In addition to the work of writers, composers, choreographers, etc., our studies will address the way that performers of color have maneuvered within the \"tight spaces\" of stereotypical songs, dances, and shows to exercise authority over their own performances. We will engage work in critical musical theatre studies by scholars including Daphne Brooks, Fred Moten, Shane Vogel, Donatella Galella, Alexandra T. Vazquez, and Brian Herrera, and musical theatre artists such as Bert Williams, Ethel Waters, Sono Osato, Pat Suzuki, Chita Rivera, André De Shields, Graciela Daniele, David Henry Hwang, George C.

We work at this kind of partnering by honoring a fundamental law of nature: Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion: \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" That is, what is particular to the way we partner in this class is that we work at creating an equal-and-opposite partnership with each other. How? By first relaxedly grounding the body - via the holistic postural-motional-vocal principle called Standing Down Straight® - and then sharing both our body's physical weight and - thinking of the word \"weight\" metaphorically - our emotional weight with each other. In each class, we practice sharing these two types of weight by becoming aware of 3 sensations: --How gravity's force - when we give in to it - relaxes our body and mind DOWN into the floor and, therefore, frees our bones to bounce more loosely at their bony connections called joints (e.g., the neck, elbows, lower back, and knees). --How the floor, in application of Newton's law, meets all our gravity-directed, falling-DOWN body-weight by equally and oppositely counter-thrusting UP into it. --How scapular abduction (sliding one scapula bone then the other forward around your ribcage) then grabs all that energy the floor is sending up to you and directs it through your hands, eyes, and voice to your partner so that the two of you can then use all that equal-and-opposite, joints-loose connecting to swing-bounce together to the songs that great swing vocalists sing and great swing bands play. This equal-and-opposite way of connecting can also explain one of its outcomes: feeling joy together. The kind of joy that can come of letting go of the tensions that drive overachieving and replacing them with singing and moving together to the infectiously hand-holding, body-bouncing, and community-making rhythms of swing."]]}]},{"i":"022906","c":"SPCH","t":"Special Topics in Acting","u":"THEATRE","n":"370-0","s":[{"i":"022906-20","r":[{"n":"Chrissy Martin"}],"t":"Special Topics in Acting","k":"Contact Improvisation for Performance","u":"THEATRE","n":"370-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["Wirtz 201 Performnce Black Box"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":12,"p":[["Overview of class","Contact improvisation is a dance form involving two or more bodies utilizing physical touch as a vehicle for spontaneous communication.

For most of us, our initial encounter with the world is in an organization - a hospital, and then most of us spend the bulk of our childhood and adolescences in another organization - a family. We spend much of our childhood and adolescence also attending yet another organization - the school. Most Americans still work in an organization as distinct from being self-employed. Organizations are a fixture in our lives at an early age and continue to play a central role across the lifespan. The ubiquity of organizations is such that we often take them for granted, rarely stopping to consider how they influence our lives. Organizational change has garnered considerable attention from academics, private consultants and policy-makers. This interest cuts across organizational sectors — for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations. This class focuses on organizational change. Studies in Organizational Change is an advanced course in the Learning & Organizational Change major designed to introduce key constructs and ideas about change in organizations. The class is organized as follows: We will begin with a discussion of the notion of change in general and organizational change in particular. We will identify different levels of analysis that scholars who study organizational change focus on. We will then examine different levers or resources for organizational change including - leadership, organizational routines, human capital, social capital, technology, culture, identity.

In this class, you'll learn to identify and analyze everyday organizations, document what's working and what's not, and figure out creative ways to redesign them. You'll conduct ethnographic fieldwork, using concepts and methods drawn from theories of human cognition as it happens in context. These concepts come from distributed cognition and actor-network approaches and stress the inextricability of humans and non-humans (i.e. tools, technologies, representations) in the conduct of everyday organizations. The broad goal is to equip you with strategies for making organizational change that can be applied across personal, professional, and community.

Their work shaped, in part, the foundations of the field of behavioral economics. As we move through the quarter, we will draw on this framework to analyze human judgment and organizational decisionmaking in medicine, public health, criminal justice, sports, and social media. We will investigate ways to use insights from research to improve the functioning of organizations, with a goal of making life better for the people that work in them and the people they serve. Importantly, we will also consider the limitations of the cognitivist perspectives of Tversky and Kahneman and will explore embodied and extended views of the mind developed by modern-day researchers. In the final project, working either independently or in a group, you will research an organizational phenomenon and develop a design for change using the theoretical perspectives from the course.

This is reflected in the literature and content that are used, and the expectations for how people interact and communicate with each other. Such restricted curriculum contributes to the fact that many students' experiences are being marginalized from schooling, and students' having difficulty identifying with what they are expected to learn (cf. Martinez, Morales & Aldana, 2017). In this class, we will read studies that tackle these issues, which are both social scientific and political issues. We will also consider new ways to think about and design learning environments that draw from and build on a diverse range of knowledge, language and cultural resources for learning - resources that are more reflective of the experiences of our students.

All digital tools (i.e. programming/coding, robotics, social media, VR/AR, games, and digital design fabrication) have the potential to be used to help learners develop their own understandings of subject-matter. But technology is not always used in ways that improve experiences of learning and teaching. The lack of realizing this potential is often due to limited views of learning that are embedded in the design and use of new technologies. In this course, we will explore views of learning that can be used to realize the promises and avoid the pitfalls that technological innovations can hold for learning in both informal and formal settings. This course is based on the premise that exploring learning with technology will allow us to deepen our understanding of how to effectively teach with technology. As educators, researchers and designers, we need our understandings of technology and its uses to be connected to the theories of learning that are enacted in our practice whether we make them explicit or not. To this end, we will examine how combinations of cognitive, sociocultural and ecological theories enable us to articulate understandings of learning that will improve our pedagogical practice. We will explore the design of activities using technologies that encourage teachers to recognize and value the multiple pathways that learners travel to make sense of new ideas. These designs also provide opportunities for multiple avenues of research related to learning and teaching. The course is designed to immerse students in the use of technological tools for learning and the design of projects for learning with various technologies. Projects, readings and writing in various genres are intended to help students to reflect on their own learning and the learning of others. Course work is also designed to provide opportunities to try out, analyze and interpret various approaches to teaching with technologies. The goal is to develop perspectives on learning and teaching with technology that enable both pre-service teachers and emerging learning scientists to create learning environments that support learners in coming to understand academic ideas, themselves, and their social/cultural contexts. For example, we will look beyond the popular assumption that coding is a good skill for all children as preparation for future economic expansion and workforce development. We will give greater attention to deeper meanings and purposes of coding. We will consider what computational thinking can be when educators attend to the new ways learners can make sense of ideas and phenomena using computational tools. The kinds of questions that emerge from the work in this class include: How can geometry be explored and understood differently with computational tools as opposed to traditional pedagogical approaches? How can engaging in inquiry using sensing devices help learners to expand their sense of possibility for what they can make, learn and do? How does the cultural context of learning inform how technology can be taken up to support learning? What new purposes and meanings for technology use might young people generate for themselves?"]]}]},{"i":"022117","c":"SESP","t":"Designing and Constructing Models with Multi-agent Languages","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"372-0","s":[{"i":"022117-20","r":[{"n":"Uri Wilensky"}],"t":"Designing and Constructing Models with Multi-agent Languages","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"372-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 303"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":10}]},{"i":"011575","c":"SESP","t":"Methods and Epistemologies for the Study of Learning 1","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"404-0","s":[{"i":"011575-20","r":[{"n":"Bruce Sherin"},{"n":"Reed Stevens"}],"t":"Methods and Epistemologies for the Study of Learning 1","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"404-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":0}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 101"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":12}]},{"i":"020389","c":"SESP","t":"Advanced Qualitative Methods","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"416-0","s":[{"i":"020389-20","r":[{"n":"James Spillane"}],"t":"Advanced Qualitative Methods","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"416-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 317"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":10}]},{"i":"000614","c":"SESP","t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"451-0","s":[{"i":"000614-21","r":[{"n":"Brian J Reiser"}],"t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","k":"Science Education Reform: From Design Research to","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"451-0","s":"21","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 317"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."}]},{"i":"016668","c":"SESP","t":"Constructionism Seminar","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"452-0","s":[{"i":"016668-20","r":[{"n":"Uri Wilensky"}],"t":"Constructionism Seminar","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"452-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 317"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":30,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."}]},{"i":"020121","c":"SESP","t":"Responsible Conduct of Research Training","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"519-0","s":[{"i":"020121-20","r":[{"n":"Reed Stevens"}],"t":"Responsible Conduct of Research Training","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"519-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":50,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."}]},{"i":"021589","c":"SESP","t":"Education Sciences Research Practicum in the Schools","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"591-0","s":[{"i":"021589-20","r":[{"n":"David Uttal"}],"t":"Education Sciences Research Practicum in the Schools","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"591-0","s":"20","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":30}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G28"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":15}]},{"i":"024907","c":"SESP","t":"Research and Analysis II","u":"MS_ED","n":"407-2","s":[{"i":"024907-20","r":[{"n":"Melanie Woodward"}],"t":"Research and Analysis II","u":"MS_ED","n":"407-2","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 345"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LAB","a":50,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisites: MS_ED 407-1","p":[["Overview of class","Teaching and education are complex, intellectual, and iterative endeavors.

We will study why the traditional markers of adulthood - leaving home, completing education, being financially independent, getting married, and having children - have become increasingly delayed and disrupted, and briefly consider the consequences of deviating from the \"standard\" life course. We will pay specific attention to how social factors (e.g., immigration status, gender and sexuality, race, class) shape young people's transitions to these stages of adult life. The second half of this course looks at what it means to grow old and age healthily. We will look at early life determinants of later-life wellbeing, the significance of social and intergenerational relationships for older people's health, work/retirement and social integration, and end-of-life issues.

It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation. The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents."]]}]},{"i":"020038","c":"SESP","t":"Economics of Education Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"332-0","s":[{"i":"020038-20","r":[{"n":"Claire Mackevicius"}],"t":"Economics of Education Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"332-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G02"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":35,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite: Students must have completed ECON 202 & SESP 210 (or equivalent) to register for this course.","p":[["Overview of class","This course explores the central themes in K-12 and higher education from an economic perspective.

Broadly, the term refers to the collective efforts of cultural producers to respond to the ever-shifting conditions of perception and social life brought on by modernity. The course examines some of the key moments in global modernity from the mid-nineteenth to mid- twentieth century. It provides a critical introduction to the rise of modern art practices from a range of locales, pushing against the hegemonic discourses upholding the Western canon to underscore the interdependencies between the Global North and the Global South. The overarching goal of this course is the consideration of how the formal concerns of distinct movements in modern art, responding to modernization, emerged out of specific historical and cultural contexts and how each movement pushed against the tastes of society at large to radically challenge ideas about art itself. Carries humanities credit.

In addition to discussing key themes in the novel, such as gender, social class, and morality, as they relate to both Austen's world and ours, we will also take a deep dive into Austen's prose style and literary techniques. We will consider how Austen uses irony, narrative voice, perspective, character development, form, and free-indirect style in ways that engage and challenge her readers.

We will read four short novels: Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground; Camus's The Stranger; Hammett's The Maltese Falcon (turned into a classic film, perhaps the first major example of film noir); and Baldwin's Giovanni's Room. Readings will also include one long novel, Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride, and one play, Sartre's No Exit. Assignments will include literary analysis papers, with options for the second topic that involve film comparisons. For the major assignment, students will work as individuals or in groups to analyze a television or movie character as an anti-hero, with an oral presentation and video clips; then each student will write their own analysis of that character.

I will provide review materials and opportunities, but please know that success in this course often rests on this prior knowledge."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of this course, you will be able to: Grasp the fundamental and beautiful themes of differential calculus, while simultaneously exploring the wider world of mathematical creativity.\nEvaluate limits of functions using a variety of methods.\nCompute derivatives both formally and using differentiation rules.\nApply the techniques of differentiation to implicit contexts and then use this method in related rates problems.\nAnalyze the behavior of a function in order to sketch the graph of a function.\nUse the derivative as a powerful tool in various applied and theoretical contexts."],["Class Materials (Required)","The primary textbook for this course is: Calculus, 14th edition. By George B. Thomas. Pearson. ISBN: 978-0-13-443898-6 Calculator (To Have or Have Not): There are wonderful online calculators and graphing calculators so this is an optional purchase. But I for one love having a calculator by my side when I am doing long, calculus problems. Here are two good ones: TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator (Links to an external site.) and TI-36X Scientific Calculator (Links to an external site.). Everything Else: In addition to old-school paper and pencils, you will also be using Canvas and Desmos and Geogebra (explained in the INTRODUCTION module--see course Canvas site). Additional required readings and media are posted on Canvas, including timely news articles, academic research, and videos that you will review in order to complete some assignments and participate in discussion forums."]]}]},{"i":"022652","c":"UC","t":"Fiction Writing Workshop","u":"MCW","n":"413-DL","s":[{"i":"022652-55","r":[{"n":"Michael Zapata"}],"t":"Fiction Writing

Social psychologists examine how people interpret the social world and investigate the influence of the social environment on individuals' thoughts and behaviors. We will examine classic topics in social psychology: social cognition, social influence, conformity, group processes, helping, and prejudice. There will be a strong emphasis on methodology and the ways in which study design affects both the research questions one can answer and the conclusions one might draw. Because social psychologists sometimes investigate \"everyday\" behavior, students often believe that they can rely on intuition or common sense to learn about social psychology. Unfortunately, one core finding in social psychology is that common sense can be misleading at best and seriously biased at worst.

The 21st century has taken the once monolithic concept of \"television\" and placed it on computer screens and smartphones. Yet the continuity of the medium is important. This course presents a political, cultural, social, and industrial history of television, from the classic network era to the post-network contemporary period of media convergence. It involves an exploration of individual programs as well as major events and shifts in television history. Programming will range from early test broadcasts, experimental programs, and popular hits like I Love Lucy, Star Trek, Twin Peaks, and Sex and the City.

The nuclear arms race is also gaining momentum, as evidenced by China's growing nuclear arsenal and the U.S. \"nuclear modernization\" program. While the use of nuclear weapons would clearly threaten humanity and the entire planet, the development, maintenance, and possession of nuclear weapons, from uranium mining to nuclear waste disposal, has profound economic and environmental consequences, especially for marginalized populations. This advanced course in the anthropology of peace examines the role of cities - city leaders and city residents - in the politics of nuclear weapons. Cities have often been considered targets for nuclear attack, and in the 1950s, U.S. city residents routinely participated in civil defense drills. Since the 1960s, city leaders and a wide range of citizens have also been active in anti-nuclear activism. The UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which entered into force in January 2021, itself the result of global civil society efforts, has reinvigorated grassroots efforts to promote nuclear disarmament. In the U.S., more than 70 municipalities, including Boston, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, have recently passed resolutions urging the federal government to support the TPNW. These resolutions have highlighted the connections between global nuclear security and critical local, national, and regional issues such as racism, gender inequality, economic inequality, environmental crisis, and memories of past violence. This course considers the potential implications of these city-level actions and conversations for national nuclear policy debates. The first half of the course will introduce the history of the development of nuclear weapons; the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; various bilateral and multilateral frameworks for nuclear non-proliferation, arms control, and disarmament; and key concepts, theories, and tools related to nuclear security. The second half of the course will critically examine the evolution of anti-nuclear activism, particularly from the \"nuclear freeze\" movement of the 1980s to the current global campaign to abolish nuclear weapons. Throughout the course, there will be opportunities to hear from a wide range of guest speakers, from defense and security experts to atomic bomb survivors, peace activists, religious leaders, and local government officials. There are no prerequisites for the course, and no prior knowledge of anthropology or security studies is required.

Characterized by gilt interiors, ornamental curves, and pastel colors, the Rococo infiltrated all forms of art making, from architecture, to painting, sculpture, porcelain, and even fashion. The style was immediately ridiculed for being overtly feminine, frivolous, and excessively luxurious. Associated intimately with the doomed queen of France, Marie Antoinette, the rococo is often cited as a direct cause of the French Revolution that would take France (and Europe) by storm in 1789. In this course we will study Rococo art, from its origins in the sixteenth century to its fall from popularity circa 1785. By unpacking both the Rococo's bad reputation and socio-political importance, we will explore how the style was both gendered and racialized. How did Rococo art challenge dominant heteronormative aesthetic practices? How did it establish and fetishize a culture of whiteness in direct opposition to a growing colonial plantation system across the Atlantic?

Over the last decade, posters announcing \"Refugees Welcome Here\" have appeared across the American landscape. The post-9/11 era has seen the displacement of 38 million people over the Middle East and North Africa due to the ever-escalating effects of US militarism, not to mention the thousands of civilians who have died in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Palestine, and surrounding regions. Against the backdrop of what Afghan anthropologist Anila Daulatzai calls \"serial war,\" what does the figure of the refugee tell us about the status of human rights in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries? In other words, what are human rights and why do we care about them? Who gets to be a human and who doesn't? Beginning with fiction from the mid-to-late twentieth century, this course examines the dialectical logic of dispensation and denial of human rights through literary texts across nations and genres. We will employ the lens of political theory around race, citizenship, territory, and the category of the human across global sites like Kashmir, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Palestine, Mexico as well as detention sites like Guantánamo, and Manus Island. The course problematizes an investment in the rhetoric sympathy and sentiment to unlearn what Didder Fassin calls \"humanitarian imperialism,\" instead asking what it means for human rights subjects to make demands, rather than petitions, for protection from torture, genocide, and extralegal violence. We will read fictional as well as nonfictional accounts by global authors to consider key figures such as the refugee, the undocumented migrant, the detainee, and the animal as instantiations of what Giorgio Agamben calls \"homo sacer,\" i.e. the human who remains outside of a polity as a sacrificial surrogate against the safe haven of the settler/citizen within.

Michelle Valerie Ronnick coined the term Classica Africana in 1996 to describe, in short, \"the influence of classical studies on people of African descent.\" Classica Africana includes those in the nineteenth century who studied and read classical literatures and languages, Greek and Latin, the students of standard formal American education as influenced by the British liberal arts system, neoclassical or black classicist writing, and, to a lesser degree, the traces of classical literatures common to popular memory. This course introduces the long history of Black Classicist literatures in the United States. Since Phillis Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773), the very first publication by an African American in the United States, black writers have engaged with classical works by Greek and Roman authors. During this class, we will read selections from Black Classicist writers and the referent texts (in translation). We will explore the variety of fiction and poetry that may include Phillis Wheatley, Ovid, Pauline E. Hopkins, Charles Chesnutt, Euripides, as well as more recent work by Toni Morrison, Donika Kelly, and Kwame Dawes & Matthew Shenoda. As a class, we will create our own set of unique inquiries and explore the answers to, at least, the following questions: How do \"the classics\" inform the stories by African American authors? What kinds of capital do classical themes, plotlines, and symbolism create for Black Classicist writers? What assumptions can we make about Black authors who rewrite classical works? In what ways are those assumptions affirmed and exploded through our semester-long literary inquiry? In what ways does Black classicism alter the way we understand the classical texts to which it refers? EXPECTATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS OVERVIEW: Assignments include a group discussion assignment, a mid-term paper, and a final group project and presentation. Students will be evaluated on their performance in these assignments as well as class attendance and participation.

The answer is ‘whiteness'. Whiteness as a word and concept can be difficult and troubling to understand for some. In this course whiteness refers to three phenomena: First, the dominant representation of people in the US who historically came to describe and understand themselves as ‘white' on the basis of exploiting, violating, segregating, oppressing, administrating, marginalizing and caricaturing those designated as ‘non-white' (e.g. Black, Native American, Asian, Latinx). Second, the hegemonic cultural norms identified as white in ruling the institutions, governments, laws, ideas, policies of the US that assume and support the sovereign dominance, rights and authority of white populations over non-white populations. Third, the inheritance and acceptance of white ruling culture (e.g. white supremacy, white privilege) as normative; and (in the post-civil rights era), the denial that whiteness exists, together with opposition to any attempts to highlight, expose or discuss it.

This requires us to think historically about Black populations, including their identities, cultures and movements in terms that include Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the United States. In short, it means understanding Blackness in the Americas as a multiplicity of Black experiences, identities, cultures, politics and histories. It is important to recall that up until the mid-point of the 20th century the overwhelming numbers of African descended (Black) populations across Africa, the Americas and Europe lived under formalized colonial and racial regimes based on different institutionalized versions of western white supremacy. During the 20th century despite Black populations in Latin America and the United States being citizens of independent countries while those in Africa and the Caribbean largely remained colonized subjects, Black populations throughout this Black Diaspora, were routinely the subjects of racial subordination, racial segregation and racial violation. It is in relation to these conditions that the course discusses political Blackness, in particular why and how it emerged and the ways in which it persists into the 21st century, enabling critiques of white supremacy and mobilizing movements of politics, culture and identification. Throughout the 20th century the colonial question of race, its rule over Black populations lives, and diverse Black resistances to race, have deeply influenced the cultural and political orientations and solidarities of Black people across the Americas. The course is a reminder that Black populations across the Americas have historically navigated and attempted to overcome through politics and culture, the same and different continuities and discontinuities of racial subordination, segregation and violation affecting Black populations. The course will focus primarily on Latin America and the Caribbean."]]}]},{"i":"001218","c":"WCAS","t":"Topics in African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":[{"i":"001218-20","r":[{"n":"Joshua Crutchfield"}],"t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"The Politics of Abolition","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":25,"p":[["Overview of class","This course explores the history of abolitionist movements as articulated by black radicals, imprisoned intellectuals, activists, and organizers, with a focus on the mid-20th century, the Black Power Movement, and the contemporary era.

Lorde defines poetry not as \"sterile word play\" but as \"a revelatory distillation of experience\" (37). Consequently, she situates the poetic in an inherent interrelation with the erotic, asserting that the erotic \"is not a question only of what we do; it is a question of how acutely and fully we can feel in the doing\" (54). Moving through a framework that insists on acutely and fully feeling what we do, as well as on doing and distilling what we feel in a manner that is revelatory, this course seeks to engage in Black feminist praxis - thinking alongside Lorde's conceptualizations of poetry and the erotic - to carefully examine myriad articulations of queer Black existence and embodied experience.

These interventions are meant to highlight the ways that queer Black storytellers and tellers of queer Black stories - including poets, novelists, critical theorists, filmmakers, actors, painters, and performance artists - mobilize the poetic and erotic to access and articulate new modes of queer Black being, feeling, and doing."]],"o":"6","f":"6"},{"i":"001218-26","r":[{"n":"Kent Brooks"}],"t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Black Music Studies: Rebellious Women of Gospel Mu","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"26","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Parkes Hall Choir Room 034"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":9,"o":"6","f":"6"},{"i":"001218-67","t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Women's History: Slavery and Freedom in the 19th C","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"67","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 213"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"001218-68","t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Women's History: Slavery and Freedom in the 19th C","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"68","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 213"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"001218-69","t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Women's History: Slavery and Freedom in the 19th C","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"69","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 212"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"001221","c":"WCAS","t":"Internship in Black Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"396-0","s":[{"i":"001221-20","t":"Internship in Black Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"396-0","s":"20","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":15}]},{"i":"016887","c":"WCAS","t":"Expressive Arts and Cultural Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"420-0","s":[{"i":"016887-20","r":[{"n":"Nicole A Spigner"}],"t":"Expressive Arts and Cultural Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"420-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Crowe 5-138 Af Am Studies Sem"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","It is impossible to capture the breadth and depth of Black people's artistic contributions, motivations, and expressions in a single quarter.

The class will read primary works from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries and bring them into conversation with current and historical popular media, the extension of the tradition/s earlier artists wrote, sung, painted, struggled with and against.

This triple gesture - linguistic, political and cultural - calls for taking seriously the original formation and expressions of Black feminisms in diasporic and global contexts. It also implies to analyze the enduring consequences of colonialism of former European empires on the very soil of their metropoles through an intersectional perspective. In this sense, this course will pay attention to the historical and social conditions of the emergence of black feminist struggles against patriarchy, racist minoritization and social inequality in a social and political context of white hegemony, where systemic racism is generally considered as \"a notion imported from the United States\". The reflections and readings will mainly focus on France, a European country which is paradigmatic of institutionalized race denial. Formerly a slave-owning colonial empire still marked by massive immigration of workers from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Indian Ocean in the 1960s, France still maintains ambiguous political and economic ties with these territories, while it actively excludes any reference to race from its official legislation as it has made colorblindness the bedrock of its national republicanism.

These are all conditions that can be analyzed within the advent and context of late global capitalism which is also often referred to as neoliberalism, or post-Fordism. The first part of this course will analyze the impetus and structural characteristics of neoliberalism or late global capitalism to better understand how it has been manifested in many of the crises already mentioned. In this section, we will scrutinize the function and logics of capitalism to identify how and why the shift from a Fordist to a Post-Fordist political economy transpired. Special attention will be paid to how capitalism interacts with and is informed by racial, colonial, and gender logics to exacerbate the vulnerability of Black, Indigenous, Brown, and other racialized groups to exploitation, removal, and premature death. We will also focus on how the situations that racialized groups in the global north face are relationally tied to the precarity that racialized populations in the global south endure. The second section of the seminar will scrutinize the ideological and psychosocial components of neoliberalism. It will focus on how neoliberalism is a corresponding ethic or mode of governance intended to atomize a polity, emphasize individualism, and thus disrupt nodes of solidarity and mutual aid. In this sense, neoliberalism influences how concepts such as liberation, freedom, or justice are theorized, imagined, taught, and organized around. This section of the seminar also foregrounds the university as an integral location for the study of neoliberalism. It focuses on how insurgent critiques of power once associated with the Third World Left of the Cold War era have been de-emphasized in favor of a growing emphasis on therapeutic adjustment, bourgeoise performances of excellence, recognition, safe space, and care."]]},{"i":"019283-22","r":[{"n":"Justin Mann"}],"t":"Graduate Topics in African American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"480-0","s":"22","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":4,"p":[["Overview of class","In this course students will assess how the novel has figured in the development of Black literature and life over the long 20th Century.

It prepares managers to understand how to best organize and motivate the human capital of the firm, manage social networks and alliances, and execute strategic change. This is accomplished through knowledge of competitive decision making, reward system design, team building, strategic negotiation, political dynamics, corporate culture and strategic organizational design.</br>\n<br>The goal of this course is to help you understand what an organizational leader does and to help\nyou develop skills to be an effective leader. The course draws on theories and empirical work\nfrom psychology, sociology, and organizational behavior relating to organizational dynamics,\nmotivation, teams, power and culture. The course is based around the idea that a leader does not\nneed formal power or authority to lead. Rather, leadership arises from the ability to mobilize\npeople around a particular challenge and commitment to take action.</br>\n<br>In addition to developing skills, as students of the world, we want to have a lens that helps us\nevaluate the contributions and consequences of leaders. Sadly, not all leaders are effective, and\ngiven the wrong motivations or circumstances, leaders can be quite destructive. Thus, as we go\nthrough our weekly readings, I will often ask you to reflect on particular leaders and assess what\nthey did well or not so well. Leaders assemble the skills, talents, and resources of individuals and\ngroups into combinations that best solve those organizational challenges. Effective leaders are\nable to solve these challenges, improve their teams, cultivate new leaders, accomplish\norganizational goals, and (hopefully) improve society in the process. In order to accomplish so\nmany things, they must be able to diagnose problems, make effective decisions, influence and\nmotivate others, manage diversity, tap into and motivate the human and social capital of\norganizational members, optimize cross-functional teams, and drive organizational change.

The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements. Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector. To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management. Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends.

The course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results.

You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses.

In this seminar, we will read and discuss representative accounts of exile from the ancient Mediterranean world, highlighting their historical and geographical specificity but also reflecting on their treatment of common concerns and themes—such as homelessness and hospitality, longing and belonging, identity and otherness, hosts and guests, refugees and havens, pain and nostalgia, presence and absence, etc. While the seminar will highlight the historical and archaeological coordinates of those narratives, we will also reflect upon their relevance in discussing the very current reality of exilic life in today's world.\nAs a first-year seminar, this course is meant to hone your abilities in the practice of academic writing.

Since its origin in the ethnographic writings of the enlightenment in the 17th and 18th century, and therefore deeply rooted in the European colonial exploitation of Africa, the fetish appears in many different incarnations in such heterogeneous discourses as theology, Marxism, sociology, psychoanalysis, the clinical psychiatry of sexual deviance, modernist aesthetics, popular culture, and anthropology.

Of course today the Persian language — or \"Farsi,\" as it is also known — is most commonly associated with the nation-state of Iran. But the historical association with world literature reveals a forgotten cosmopolitanism. Before the nineteenth century, Persian served for nearly a millennium as the literary and political lingua francaacross virtually the entire eastern Islamic world, including vast stretches of South, Central, and West Asia. This course will introduce students to some of the most common genres of Indo-Persian literature, such as the romantic epic (masnavi), the courtly panegyric (qasida), the quatrain (ruba‘i) and especially the lyric (ghazal), as well as to some of the canonical poets of the era and the historical context in which they lived and wrote. Expressions of love, longing, devotion, and dissent against religious orthodoxy were among the most common themes of this literature, giving rise to its many modern afterlives — for example, in Urdu and Turkish literature, but also in European Romantic poetry, American Transcendentalist philosophy, and the music of Bollywood cinema, to name just a few. All readings will be in English or in English translation, so no prior knowledge of Persian is required for this course; but students who do have some familiarity with Persian, or with related languages like Urdu, Turkish, or Arabic, are of course most welcome to read texts in the original languages if they so desire.

[…] It would be advisable, therefore, to drop the name in that sense […]\" Scarcely ten years later, in his Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant grudgingly revises his view and seeks precisely to construe \"the faculty of taste (Geschmacksvermögen) as an aesthetic power of judgment\" from a \"transcendental point of view\" (in transzendentaler Absicht). In so doing, Kant acknowledges that the major challenge to defining a transcendental principle of aesthetic judgment consists in its \"immediate relation [to] feelings of pleasure and displeasure.\" How the immediacy of this relation might derive from a principle that is neither psychological nor empirical, but transcendental and a priori, constitutes the enigma -- \"das Rätselhafte\" - that his Critique seeks to resolve. But Kant had no illusions concerning \"the great difficulty involved in resolving a problem that nature has rendered so complex (verwickelt hat).\" I suggest that nothing less is involved in this \"complexity\" than the task of rethinking the way singularities - events that don't conform to established general schemes - can be communicated and shared. Which is to say, encountered and experienced collectively. The seminar will retrace the contours and trajectory of Kant's response to this encounter with the singular, through a close reading of the first part of Kant's Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment. In the process, the interdependence of knowing and feeling will be reexamined in relation to a notion that plays no obvious role in Kant's lexicon (although it will later for Freud), namely, tension."]]}]},{"i":"001640","c":"WCAS","t":"Independent Reading","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"490-0","s":[{"i":"001640-20","r":[{"n":"Corey Byrnes","p":"847/467-3314","a":"1880 Campus Drive, Kresge Hall, Office 4-548","o":"Varies quarter to quarter, please check with instructor."}],"t":"Independent Reading","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"490-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"IND","a":15}]},{"i":"001903","c":"WCAS","t":"Earth Science for the 21st Century","u":"EARTH","n":"101-0","s":[{"i":"001903-01","r":[{"n":"Steven Jacobsen","p":"847.467.1825","a":"Tech F297","o":"by appointment"}],"t":"Earth Science for the 21st Century","u":"EARTH","n":"101-0","s":"01","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Lutkin Hall"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":250,"p":[["Overview of class","Earth science encompasses the geology, chemistry, biology, and physics of our planet, while appreciating its beauty.

The lecture portion of the course will highlight/review Earth science concepts, while the modeling component of the course will focus on the design, construction, and use of models to test hypotheses, and increase understanding of the forces and processes that shape the global environment. The modeling software to be used will be appropriate to undergraduates and beginning graduate students who do not have previous experience with solving differential equations or with computer programming, though students with these skill sets will appreciate the manifestation of numerical rules in the software package.

Students will understand the measurement of price level changes, labor market variables, productivity, and the macroeconomic imbalances that can exist with the government budget and for assets and trade flows between nations in world markets. Students will understand the monetary and financial systems and how they contributed to our current situation, both in the US and Europe.

Here in the United States, this harmful dynamic is quite evident in the fact that marriage between individuals belonging to different races was banned by most states until 1967.

How do poems reach across oceans and continents, in and out of exile? How does one find or make a poetic \"home\" within a diaspora (a word that refers to the movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from an established or ancestral homeland)? How do poetic depictions of home carry within them the enormous histories, memories, and experiences of a distant or absent homeland? Together we will explore these questions as we read a wide range of poems about the experiences of being in exile, in diaspora, and at home. At the same time, we will read about and discuss the political and philosophical stakes of being a diasporic subject in our current moment, as the consequences of climate change, war, and political repression have created a global refugee crisis of previously unimaginable scale. Concurrently, we will also seek to answer questions about poetry itself: how do poems written in diaspora imagine - or reimagine - home? Are there unique ways in which diasporic poetry makes meaning?

From early colonial contact to the Cold War space race, writers have seized on \"the frontier\" as an essentially American place. Before the existence of the United States, pilgrims imagined taming the \"wilderness\" to create a \"garden,\" a new Eden in a new world. Across the 19th century, the iconic figure of the American cowboy emerged—a rugged, masculine individualist obeying his own moral code, not the letter of the law. In the 1960s, space figured as a \"final frontier,\" prompting book, film, and television production. In a bizarre mashup of tropes, Jeff Bezos wore a cowboy hat on his flight into space on Blue Origin. Together, we will investigate representations of the \"frontier\" across its many forms in American cultural production. Readings will feature excerpts from Edgar Allan Poe's Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (1838) and Willa Cather's O Pioneers! (1913). Film and television include the science fiction drama of alien contact, Arrival (2016), and selections from the futuristic space Western Cowboy Bebop (1998 and 2021). As a group, we will supplement these materials based on class interest—I will provide descriptions of additional possible texts. Along the way, we will ask: What is the appeal of the \"frontier\"? How do frontiers stretch how people think of themselves? Why imagine a place beyond the rule of law? What is our relationship to artificial intelligence as an emerging frontier? Throughout our exploration of the theme of the frontier, we will write short papers, building into a draft and revision of a formal essay. In doing so, we will aim to meet the learning goals of Weinberg College for the first-year seminar: to learn how to pose interesting questions; to research and gather evidence; to organize that evidence into a convincing argument; and to develop an engaging voice and style."]]},{"i":"024843-23","r":[{"n":"Laura MacKay Hansen"}],"t":"First-Year Writing Seminar","k":"Coming of Age in Literature and Film","u":"ENGLISH","n":"101-8","s":"23","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":12,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Weinberg First Year Seminars are only available to first-year students.","p":[["Overview of class","Growing up is hard to do—whether surrounded by the turbulence and poverty of post-war Naples, the violence of war-torn Vietnam, the devastation of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran, or the more genteel decline of an American auto town in the 1970's. This course will explore coming-of-age stories and some of the challenges presented both by difficult and complicated relationships, and by the social and political forces that shape the worlds in which the protagonists are raised. What role do friendships and family play in creating identity, and how might betrayal be a part of growing up? How are the stakes different and higher for some, and how do gender, race, and class play a role in narrowing a person's choices? We'll begin by considering the novel and tv series, My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante, looking in particular at the female friendship at its center; then we'll examine some of the ways that coming of age is represented in film, looking at Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, Sophia Coppola's Virgin Suicides, and Greta Gerwig's Ladybird; we'll think about the way that graphic memoirs can capture both the personal and the historical, considering Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis and Thi Bui's The Best We Could Do; and finally, we'll consider how films like Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Jordan Peele's Get Out might make us think differently about what it means to come of age and help us consider the question: How do we push against the life stories that have been chosen for us?"]]},{"i":"024843-24","r":[{"n":"Lingyi Xu"}],"t":"First-Year Writing Seminar","k":"The Many Faces of Jane Eyre","u":"ENGLISH","n":"101-8","s":"24","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":12,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Weinberg First Year Seminars are only available to first-year students.","p":[["Overview of class","Who is Jane Eyre?

Originally considered to be a form of trash writing, the genre now manifests itself in various cultural forms: novels, short stories, movies, poems, theatre, and graphic novels. Gothic texts thrive on depicting the unspeakable horrors and pleasures that make up our psychological lives. Unsurprisingly, then, they have been hugely popular across history. They make great examples of how popular writing has served as a medium for authors to think through complex and broad-ranging issues, engaging questions of identity, race, gender, and sexuality. Writing Trash looks at gothic literature to think through the following questions: how do we write, and how do we write better? In this course, we will examine a few exemplary instances of gothic writing — such as Jekyll and Hyde, and Destroyer — to illuminate and demystify the process of expository writing. Our insights about gothic literature will serve as material for understanding and asking questions about how we practice the art of writing. What constitutes ‘good' and ‘bad' writing, and who decides? What is style? What is the relation between fictional or creative writing and expository or critical writing? Our chosen gothic texts will allow us to see how writing to tell a story involves careful use of the raw materials of language: vocabulary, syntax, style. In turn, Writing Trash will inculcate a practice of thinking about the writing process that you can take away and apply further in telling stories that are important to you."],["Class Materials (Required)","Robert Louis Stevenson, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, 978-0141439730\nVictor LaValle, Destroyer, 978-1684150557"]]}]},{"i":"024827","c":"WCAS","t":"First-Year Writing Seminar","u":"ENGLISH","n":"105-8","s":[{"i":"024827-20","r":[{"n":"Meaghan Fritz","p":"847/467-6162","a":"555 Clark St, #238"}],"t":"First-Year Writing Seminar","k":"Bon Appetit!

This course explores the social, political, and literary valences of energy to unearth the term's numerous and vastly divergent meanings. Over the quarter, we'll read texts ranging from Victorian novels to present day science fiction, tracking different understandings of energy that blur the line between scientific and imaginative ways of thinking. In our class discussions we'll enquire how literary authors use energy as a metaphor to name a variety of social dynamics like race, gender, class, empire, nature, and god. Reading literary texts alongside a social history of science, we'll use short writing tasks and class presentations to ask: how does the science of energy make its way through literature into our imaginations about the world? We will spend time with literary artefacts and study them with the premise that energy is both a force materially vital to life on earth and a vast imaginative resource for the worlds and societies we seek to build.

By focusing on human representations of animals and the nonhuman more broadly, this seminar delves into the question of how literary re-presentations of the natural world work - this is both a practical and a philosophical question. To address it, we'll analyze the raw materials and core resources of the written word: close observation and description; perspective, point-of-view, and matters of voice; anthropomorphizing and/or animalizing imagery; and the mind-bendingly disparate frameworks of narrative, human, evolutionary, and planetary time. In return, our readings will also trouble assumptions about how exclusively \"human\" we humans ever really are when we write.

If only a knight in shining armor would arrive on the scene to untangle the web of lies, or rescue the damsel in distress, or solve the puzzle of \"whodunit?\" And that's exactly how fictional detectives are often characterized. Indeed, the very first fictional detective, Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin, had the title Le Chevalier, the French word for a knight. This figure of the knight invites us to consider the detective's investigation as a lonely, but noble and heroic, quest for the truth. It also invites us to assume that the quest is undertaken by a gentleman for the sake of a lady's honor, and that the grail-like truth is something that only he will be able to discover. What happens, however, when the truth-seeker is no longer a man of honor, or a man at all? Or, when the lady in question is no longer in distress, but the cause of the distress? Or, when the social order on whose behalf the detective-knight supposedly works is no longer committed to seeking the truth, but to covering it up? That's when things get interesting. We'll begin our class with Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" which raises pointed questions of human culpability and bestial violence, and end with Colson Whitehead's The Intuitionist, which transforms the detective's traditional powers of \"deduction\" based on empirical evidence into something like its opposite, pure \"intuition.\" Along the way, we will examine who gets to occupy the position of the detective, and how the identity of the detective affects both the quest for truth and its relationship to power.

From cases of mistaken identity to specters of missed opportunities, what happens when desire gets oriented, misdirected, or redirected in different ways? If love triangles seem to position the third person as antagonist, then what happens when the third person instead becomes a vector through which the other two characters may express their mutual desire? We will consider the queer undertones (or, in some cases, overtones) of triangulated relations and the ways in which love triangles often open up alternative narrative trajectories that make us consider what might have been or what could be.

Due to women's historical exclusion from independent paid labor, girls were expected to turn into women who became wives. This social expectation was interrogated, re-imagined, and subverted in new ways across the developing form(s) of prose fiction in Britain in the \"long\" eighteenth century (roughly 1660 - 1820). As we will see, the marriage plot ascribed to Austen was far from the norm in the pre-realist novel: we'll encounter extra-marital sexual autonomy, sapphic desire, incest, sex work, delusion, discipline, remarriage, and many other plot twists which show that the literary-historical road to the courtship plot was rocky, contested, and definitely not predictable.

This course will serve as an introduction to the application of disability studies in literature. We will explore a range of questions: how do we approach the representation of disability in texts by non-disabled authors? How do we differentiate (or should we?) between disability and chronic illness, or between physical and mental disabilities? Can literary representation operate as activism? How do we parse the gap between disability as metaphor and lived experience? What does literature offer disability studies, and why should disability studies be a core method for studying literature?

Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning.

Utopias portray visions of idealized societies, while novels operate in the mode of a critical realism scrutinizing the present. In this class, we will try to understand the place of utopian thinking in eighteenth-century novels. Are utopianism and realism at odds in the early novel? Does the critical potential of realism need the normative guidance of utopian thought to be effective? Why do embedded utopias become more scarce in later novels, and how is realism able to get along without them? This class will read an array of early novels with embedded utopias. (Possibilities include: Cervantes, Don Quixote; Swift, Gulliver's Travels (book 4); Mandeville, Fable of the Bees; Fielding, Joseph Andrews; Rousseau, Julie; Goethe, Wilhelm Meister; Jane Austen, Persuasion; Mary Shelley, Frankenstein.) We will also read a selection of early utopias such as More's Utopia and Bacon's New Atlantis. Alongside these texts, we will read contemporary critical writing about utopias (Bloch, Jameson), realism (Watt, Lukacs, Jameson) and the crisis of ends-oriented thinking in eighteenth century ethics and politics (Horkheimer, Charles Taylor, Alasdair MacIntyre, Thomas Pfau).

Moving historically, roughly decade by decade from the 1960s to the present, the main task of the class will be to consider the difference digital computational technologies make in the creation of aesthetic forms and the experience of them. For instance, what new forms and modes of experience become possible with computers? What exactly makes something \"digital\"? And how can we tell (or not) -- and does it matter at all -- if something was made with the aid of automated processes? And finally, how do the answers to these questions change as we move from one computational era to another, e.g. from the mainframe and hobbyist eras to the domestic reception of popular electronics and computers in the 1980s to the emergence of the World Wide Web and social media and smartphones in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s up to and possibly beyond our historical present. The seminar will also emphasize the formal analysis of a range of both experimental and popular works across media, taking care to measure the aesthetic and historical meanings of the digital in the changing imagination of computers as central to society. Finally, students will encounter and write about forms native to their chosen discipline (literature, visual art, the moving image, music) but also about newer forms that do not fit easily into discipline-specific histories.

It thus paradoxically is a relation that often goes without saying: you are supposed to recognize likeness when you see it.

Indeed, it has become increasingly obvious that achievement of Paris temperature objectives will require both aggressive emission reduction initiatives and large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal/negative emissions technologies and processes (CDR), sometimes also referred to as a major sub-category of climate geoengineering. Moreover, many believe that we will also need to deploy solar radiation management approaches, which seek to reduce the amount of incoming solar radiation, to buy us time as we decarbonize the world economy.

Students gain an understanding of questions relating to social inequalities and diversities from a \"French Global\" perspective, while focusing on French definitions and experiences of (in)equality and diversity, and how these play out in terms of race and ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation.

This course is designed especially for students planning a career in the health professions, global health, and/or public health.\" In this course, students will gain knowledge of the different models of healthcare systems in Francophone countries as well as familiarity with some specific terminologies and grammatical structures employed in the field. Using communicative and task-based approaches, students will discuss current issues, examine and reflect on ethical beliefs and values, through topics such as healthcare access, terminal illness, the use of technology etc. Class discussions and activities as well as written assignments will be based on videos, readings and press articles, related to the medical field. Students will research topics and share their findings through oral presentations. They will also explore their personal area of interest in the field. Note: For students in Global Health Studies, this course is approved as a non-GHS elective. Students' testimonies:\n\"This course teaches so much not just about the technical aspects of health and healthcare, but also provides a well-rounded approach to the French language and the cultures of Francophone countries. Taking this course allowed me to expand my vocabulary, practice my reading and oral comprehension skills, and perfect my presentation techniques through exploring my own topics of interest.

In this course, we will take Claude Gueux as a case study and ask how we might reconstruct how a reader in 1834 might have understood what Hugo meant when he said that two prisoners were \"friends,\" and reconfigure the sexual categories that were operative before the invention of homosexuality. We will read a range of literary and other published texts from the July Monarchy that discuss criminal and prisoner intimacies. We will also analyze how 19th-century criminal and prisoner intimacy has been understood over time through its representations in the 20th and 21st centuries.

We will then turn to Jacques Rancière's rethinking of the politics of aesthetics in terms of a dissensual logic of equality—a logic which is developed not only in Rancière's readings of canonical literary works, but also in his discussions of the poetics of history and the dissensual literary practice of proletarian writers. We will then consider Gilles Deleuze's thought on art, cinema and literature, beginning with his books on Marcel Proust and Francis Bacon, before moving on to a discussion of those of his writings where the problem of aesthetic politics comes to the fore—notably, in his collaborative work with Félix Guattari and in his writings on film, as well as in his reframing of the problem of the politics of form (where \"the visible\" and \"the sayable\" are thought as \"formalizations\" of relations of force) in dialogue with the work of Michel Foucault.

We also will consider the social, cultural, and political implications of nightlife and dance music as a site of community-building, friendship, and love within contemporary Western society, especially for queer communities.

[…] It would be advisable, therefore, to drop the name in that sense […]\" Scarcely ten years later, in his Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant grudgingly revises his view and seeks precisely to construe \"the faculty of taste (Geschmacksvermögen) as an aesthetic power of judgment\" from a \"transcendental point of view\" (in transzendentaler Absicht). In so doing, Kant acknowledges that the major challenge to defining a transcendental principle of aesthetic judgment consists in its \"immediate relation [to] feelings of pleasure and displeasure.\" How the immediacy of this relation might derive from a principle that is neither psychological nor empirical, but transcendental and a priori, constitutes the enigma -- \"das Rätselhafte\" - that his Critique seeks to resolve. But Kant had no illusions concerning \"the great difficulty involved in resolving a problem that nature has rendered so complex (verwickelt hat).\" I suggest that nothing less is involved in this \"complexity\" than the task of rethinking the way singularities - events that don't conform to established general schemes - can be communicated and shared. Which is to say, encountered and experienced collectively. The seminar will retrace the contours and trajectory of Kant's response to this encounter with the singular, through a close reading of the first part of Kant's Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment. In the process, the interdependence of knowing and feeling will be reexamined in relation to a notion that plays no obvious role in Kant's lexicon (although it will later for Freud), namely, tension."],["Learning Objectives","Students will be expected to have developed an understanding of how the idea of \"singularity\" -- which is different from \"individuality\" and \"uniqueness\" -- relates to aesthetics in general and literature and language in particular.

This course introduces students to the philosophical and attitudinal changes regarding nature, childhood, and family life that enabled society to view the \"wild boy\" not as a freak or savage, but as a person inherently capable of civility, sensibility, and intelligence. The story of the \"wild boy \"teaches why it is important for humans to treat nature with respect and not fear.

This seminar is an opportunity to reflect on the historical intersections among Islam, modernity, and colonialism, using South Asia as a regional site and gender as an analytical category. The course is divided into two unequal parts. Part One focuses on ideological responses to historical transformations in various parts of the Muslim world. Part Two shifts to South Asia and examines how these ideas of change manifested in this region. Based on texts composed by Muslim women and Muslim male theologians, we will consider the following issues: reformist education, marriage and divorce, gender segregation, property ownership, and Muslim women's political participation. In analyzing these questions, we will elucidate the complexity of Islamic intellectual traditions and emphasize their historical dynamism, especially in colonial and post-colonial contexts.

We will compare both the nature of the failures and the social responses to the failure over time, and develop critical contrasts as well as comparisons to crises in our contemporary moment.

While the increased attention to Latinos may feel \"new,\" Latino communities have played a pivotal role in U.S. history for centuries. In this course, we will explore the 500-year history of Latinos in the United States—and, indeed, across the Americas—from the 16th century through the early 21st century. In its broadest sense, Latino History offers a reinterpretation of United States history that focuses on race, migration, labor, and empire. It is also the history of a community—or several communities, including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans, Central Americans, and Cuban Americans, and others—that represents a growing percentage of the U.S. population as a whole, and one that will increasingly influence the politics, social life, culture, and economy of the United States. Although we will focus on the United States, we also will examine the movement of Latino peoples within and between the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations. Ultimately, you will gain a deeper understanding of the issues and histories that bring Latinos together, those that continue to divide them, their multiple and shifting racial classification, and the long struggles for equality and belonging that have animated their histories."]],"o":"4"},{"i":"019772-60","t":"The History of Latinas and Latinos in the United States","u":"HISTORY","n":"218-0","s":"60","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"DIS","o":"4"},{"i":"019772-61","t":"The History of Latinas and Latinos in the United States","u":"HISTORY","n":"218-0","s":"61","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L28"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"DIS","o":"4"},{"i":"019772-62","t":"The History of Latinas and Latinos in the United States","u":"HISTORY","n":"218-0","s":"62","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L28"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"DIS","o":"4"}]},{"i":"023815","c":"WCAS","t":"Pirates, Guns, and Empires","u":"HISTORY","n":"262-0","s":[{"i":"023815-20","r":[{"n":"Scott Sowerby","p":"847/491-7356","a":"Harris Hall Room 207","b":"Scott Sowerby (Ph.D., Harvard, 2006) specializes in the history of early modern Britain and Europe.

Of course today the Persian language — or \"Farsi,\" as it is also known — is most commonly associated with the nation-state of Iran. But the historical association with world literature reveals a forgotten cosmopolitanism. Before the nineteenth century, Persian served for nearly a millennium as the literary and political lingua franca across virtually the entire eastern Islamic world, including vast stretches of South, Central, and West Asia. This course will introduce students to some of the most common genres of Indo-Persian literature, such as the romantic epic (masnavi), the courtly panegyric (qasida), the quatrain (ruba‘i) and especially the lyric (ghazal), as well as to some of the canonical poets of the era and the historical context in which they lived and wrote. Expressions of love, longing, mysticism, and dissent against religious orthodoxy were among the most common themes of this literature, giving rise to its many modern afterlives — for example, in Urdu and Turkish literature, but also in European Romantic poetry, American Transcendentalist philosophy, and the music of Bollywood cinema, to name just a few. All readings will be in English or in English translation, so no prior knowledge of Persian is required for this course; but students who do have some familiarity with Persian, or with related languages like Urdu, Turkish, or Arabic, are of course most welcome to read texts in the original languages if they so desire.

At a time in which women's social roles were severely circumscribed, religious women and female religious communities flourished across Europe. Early modern women levitated, bilocated [appeared in two places at once], experienced visions, battled with the devil, wrote autobiographies, and pioneered religious missions around the world. Working within traditions and cultures that subordinated them to men, some religious women carved out relatively independent lives devoted to charity, teaching, and prayer (occasionally gaining fame, fortune, and notoriety along the way).

From the late second millennium BCE to the eighteenth century CE, pastoral nomads emerged, often from the fringes of Eurasian civilizations, and wielding substantial military force influenced sedentary states, empires, and societies, from China to the Middle East and Europe. Beyond their military prowess, however, they also functioned as cultural agents. Sedentary people - Chinese, European, Muslim or others - portrayed them as violent intruders negatively impacting their cultures; yet nomads also facilitated and directed the exchange of goods, people, animals, religions, ideas, and technologies across civilizational boundaries, and maintained a relationship of interdependence with their settled neighbors. This course offers a comparative perspective on the role nomadic societies had in world history, spanning the early nomadic empire of the Xiongnu in nowadays Mongolia, Chinggis Khan's universal empire, the Berber Arabs of North Africa, and the Turkish armies in Asia Minor.

And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective.

Using Turkey as the class's main case study but also discussing intersections between popular music and nationalism from Mexico and the United States to Greece, Brazil, and beyond, we will also explore issues like globalization, cultural flows, gender, queerness, and social movements related to music. The class will follow the major turning points of Turkey's history (the westernization movements of the late Ottoman Empire, the establishment of the Turkish Republic, military coups and other crises, social and everyday transformations) through its important musicians, genres, and scenes. While studying specific musical trends (like rock 'n' roll, for example) and their social/historical underpinnings, the class will provide students with broader methodologies and theories for using popular culture and music in the study of history."]],"o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"002149","c":"WCAS","t":"Research Seminar","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":[{"i":"002149-20","r":[{"n":"Ji-Yeon Yuh","p":"847/467-6538","a":"Harris Hall - Room 306 (Winter 2021 - Remote)","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Research Seminar","k":"Korean War Legacies","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-435"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Freshmen may not register for this course.","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"002149-22","r":[{"n":"Sarah-Louise Josephine Dawtry"}],"t":"Research Seminar","k":"Depicting America","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":"22","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 305"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Freshmen may not register for this course.","p":[["Overview of class","Visual culture - art, photographs, cartoons, fashion, films, advertisements, and reels, to name but a few elements - is something often experienced with little thought as to its broader significance.

We will examine topics such as the formation of national identity, the visual language of empire, race and representation, consumerism, and the influence of mass media, while also developing a critical vocabulary with which to discuss these topics. We will situate images and objects both within their own history of making and as products of a broader cultural and social context, using them to track the complex and shifting socio-political landscape of the United States' history.

However, as historian David Bushnell stated in his 1993 seminal book, Colombia is one of \"the least studied of the major Latin American countries, and probably the least understood\" in the US academia. This course puts Colombia back on the map asking instead how its histories illustrate fundamental questions about modernity and democracy in the Americas. We begin by inquiring how different actors imagined a republic after the wars of independence, then move on to examine the irruption of the masses in the public sphere to shed light on the struggles of the popular sectors to craft citizenship vis-à-vis local and national elites. We also study the legacies and consequences of these conflicts in the 20th century, and the various social and political crises as they unfolded until our present times. We conclude exploring the country's recent history: the neoliberal turn, the persistence of violence, everyday practices of resistance and accommodation, and the labors of memory. We do so by putting the historiography in conversation with the interdisciplinary literature and a collection of primary sources."],["Registration Requirements","Graduate students only"],["Learning Objectives","Students will create their own historiographical and theoretical map on the socioeconomic, political and cultural struggles that have defined the formation of the Colombian nation-state from the 19th century to the present time.

Together we'll survey such topics as Jacques Cousteau's deep-sea filmmaking, cinematic narratives of dams and hydropower, and the representation of fictional underwater creatures, both fearsome and friendly. We'll ask: How does water relate to theories of cinematic landscape? How has water inspired new forms of vision? What different purposes can these aquatic films serve in our era of ecological concern? Students will engage with a range of narrative, documentary, and experimental films to develop a broad understanding of water's history as a vital resource, a geography of exploration and exploitation, and a source of aesthetic pleasure and symbolic meaning."],["Learning Objectives","Students will develop an understanding of media studies approaches within the environmental humanities and the so-called ‘blue humanities' more specifically.

This course explores the social, political, and literary valences of energy to unearth the term's numerous and vastly divergent meanings. Over the quarter, we'll read texts ranging from Victorian novels to present day science fiction, tracking different understandings of energy that blur the line between scientific and imaginative ways of thinking. In our class discussions we'll enquire how literary authors use energy as a metaphor to name a variety of social dynamics like race, gender, class, empire, nature, and god. Reading literary texts alongside a social history of science, we'll use short writing tasks and class presentations to ask: how does the science of energy make its way through literature into our imaginations about the world? We will spend time with literary artefacts and study them with the premise that energy is both a force materially vital to life on earth and a vast imaginative resource for the worlds and societies we seek to build.

instrument of foreign policy. It will focus on the role of aid in five main periods of U.S. foreign policy: 1) the Marshall Plan and the struggle for Europe (1945-1961), 2) superpower competition in the developing world (1961-1989), 3) aiding the transition to democratic governance (1989-present), 4) countering violent religious extremism in the Islamic world (2001-present), and 5) meeting the challenge of globalization (present day). We will look at how development aid emerged as a response to the superpower competition of the Cold War. The world's first major aid package, the Marshall Plan, was a key component in the U.S. strategy of containment: it was designed to prevent further Soviet encroachment into Central and Western Europe. With success of the Marshall Plan in Europe, Washington adopted foreign as a tool to contain the spread of Communism elsewhere, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America. With the end of the Cold War, the focus of development aid changed to reflect Washington's evolving strategic priorities. The collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe led to the danger of conflict and instability there, and presented the U.S. with the new challenge of aiding the newly independent states with their transition to democracy and the market economy. Congress responded with the Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) Act for Eastern Europe, and the FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) in the former Soviet Union. The attack of September 11, 2001 awoke Washington to the danger of violent Islamic extremism. As in 1989, Congress responded to the need to counter this phenomenon with new aid packages. In this section of the course, we will focus primarily on efforts to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, both during and after U.S. military action there. Finally, we will conclude by looking at how the challenges of globalization, particularly climate change and emerging health threats, are shaping today's foreign aid strategies. In the final week, students will present their ideas for future directions for foreign aid, in the form a briefing on their final project -- a set of recommendations on development policy for a hypothetical President."],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be based on class participation, including an oral briefing on the student's final project in the last week (30%), a short midterm essay on the role of the Marshall Plan in the eruption of the Cold War (20%, 3-5 pages), and a final paper (50%), where the student will develop a \"Policy Memorandum\" on strategies for a hypothetical new President.

For over 20 years, the Citizen Lab -- an interdisciplinary research laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto (which the instructor founded and currently directs) -- has investigated issues at the intersection of information and communication technologies, human rights, and global security. We use a \"mixed methods\" approach to research combining practices from political science, law, computer science, engineering, and area studies. We see ourselves as a kind of \"early warning system,\" looking over the horizon, or peering beneath the covers of the technological systems that surround us, to expose abuses of power, violations of human rights, or other threats to privacy and security. The Citizen Lab is a pioneer in a new and growing field of \"digital accountability\" research. After setting the stage with some general readings on background and context, we turn to several modules organized as detailed examinations of the Citizen Lab's mixed methods research on information controls, including analyzing Internet and social media censorship and surveillance, investigating targeted digital espionage, and analyzing the harms and consequences of growing digital transnational repression. We conclude with an exploration of threat modeling and how each of you can improve your own digital hygiene."]]},{"i":"003477-2","r":[{"n":"Peter Slevin"}],"t":"Special Topics in International Studies","k":"Dilemmas of American Power","u":"INTL_ST","n":"390-0","s":"2","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Fisk Hall 307"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":18,"p":[["Overview of class","Course title: Dilemmas of American Power It isn't easy being a superpower. For the past 75 years, U.S. policymakers have struggled to define America's role in an ever more complex world where threats multiply and challenges morph and endure. The period beginning with the Cold War traces an arc that reaches from nuclear arsenals to fleets of unmanned drones, from a fear of falling dominoes in Southeast Asia to a raft of conflicts in the Middle East and Europe. And, now, amid war and uncertainty, the United States has a new president who rode into office on a promise of \"America First.\" In his first weeks, he upended 60 years of support for foreign aid, announced his goal of controlling the Gaza Strip and imposed tariffs on close allies. The course draws upon an engaging set of case studies and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means. As the course progresses, we will pay particular attention to the foreign policy choices of President Trump and the domestic debate about those choices. Lecture and discussion.

From Marvel movies to daily news predicting natural disasters in the upcoming decades due to human extractive activities, today we are constantly exposed to dire visions of the future.

Dystopias can be political, social, environmental, racial—among others—but they all have something in common: they express our anxieties stemming from our experience of the present. This course offers a transnational overview of different types of dystopias (ecological, political, racial, technological) in the Americas and promotes critical engagement with these narratives. We will explore movies, tv series, short stories, and artworks from Latin America-Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico—and the United States to understand how dystopias can articulate our deepest fears and anxieties, but also how, in critiquing the present, they might suggest alternatives to think outside our nightmares and envision better futures."]]},{"i":"016391-21","r":[{"n":"Dinara Yermekovna Urazova"}],"t":"Integrating Project Seminar","k":"Power and Media in a Mutlipolar World","u":"INTL_ST","n":"395-0","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 218"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":6,"p":[["Overview of class","Course title: Power and Media in a Mutlipolar World This course will introduce students to various theories, concepts, and approaches to studying the connection between developments in media/technologies and political processes.

Our geographic scope is global, given the worldwide reach of these technologies. We will examine how various regimes differ in their adoption and utilization of these technologies, how a variety of new actors arise on the political scene to challenge existing regimes, and how actors fail or succeed in their usage and incorporation of media/technologies. Among the key issues we will explore is the power to influence perception, the power to influence emotions, and the power to control narratives. We will see how thinkers and scholars understand these issues from a variety of perspectives, both old and new."]]}]},{"i":"020178","c":"WCAS","t":"Introduction to Sustainability: Challenges and Solutions","u":"ISEN","n":"210-0","s":[{"i":"020178-20","r":[{"n":"Udayan Singh"}],"t":"Introduction to Sustainability: Challenges and Solutions","u":"ISEN","n":"210-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":30}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G21"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":115,"o":"3"}]},{"i":"025178","c":"WCAS","t":"Issues in Environmental Philosophy","u":"ISEN","n":"375-0","s":[{"i":"025178-20","r":[{"n":"Kasey Owen Hettig-Rolfe"}],"t":"Issues in Environmental Philosophy","u":"ISEN","n":"375-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":25,"o":"5","f":"5"}]},{"i":"020062","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","u":"ISEN","n":"390-0","s":[{"i":"020062-20","r":[{"n":"Manohar Kulkarni","p":"847/467-6741","a":"Technological Institute, Rm B290, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS"}],"t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","u":"ISEN","n":"390-0","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G30"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":10}]},{"i":"021075","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","u":"ISEN","n":"495-0","s":[{"i":"021075-22","r":[{"n":"Sailesh Chutani"}],"t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","u":"ISEN","n":"495-0","s":"22","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 2370"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-05-05","c":"LEC","a":30},{"i":"021075-23","r":[{"n":"Michael E Legatt"}],"t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","u":"ISEN","n":"495-0","s":"23","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 2370"],"d":"2025-05-06","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":30}]},{"i":"003078","c":"WCAS","t":"Elementary Italian","u":"ITALIAN","n":"101-1","s":[{"i":"003078-20","r":[{"n":"Daniele Biffanti"}],"t":"Elementary Italian","u":"ITALIAN","n":"101-1","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"LEC","a":18,"p":[["Overview of class","A beginning course in Italian language and culture, Elementary Italian is devoted to developing all four language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) within the three modes of communication (interpersonal, interpretive, presentational).

How do the letters challenge or reinforce the ideal of the Roman matrona, and what does this reveal about Roman cultural expectations in light of Augustus' contemporary moral legislation?

As such, throughout this course, students will:\n•\tObserve the forms, genres, and styles of literary and artistic expression in Cuban and Cuban American literary and cultural production of the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century through the practices of close reading and the analysis of cultural objects.\n•\tGain an awareness of the social, political, cultural, and historical factors influencing artistic expression in post-revolutionary Cuba and the Cuban diaspora, the relations between the artist and the public, and the potential of creative art to challenge or to affirm social and cultural norms. •\tGain an appreciation for the ways in which literature and the arts engage with and represent social movements and political change; the treatment of histories (literary and political), and questions of national and regional identity formation, and the relationship of exile and diaspora to these questions. •\tThrough class participation, an oral presentation, and written assignments, students will produce acts of persuasive interpretation, analysis, and commentary on literature, film, and visual art.\n•\tStudents will develop their writing and speaking skills in Spanish and sharpen their powers of interpretation, critique, and aesthetic perception. This will involve summarizing, close reading, contextualizing and synthesizing analyses of course texts in two short essays and a final project. Students will engage with scholarship on a wide range of processes that shaped literary and cultural production in contemporary Cuba and by Cuban writers and artists in the diaspora.

Class discussion will count for 20% of the final grade; here, too, improvement always helps. Each student should arrive at class fully prepared to discuss the assigned readings, videos, and films for the day. To encourage the full preparedness of reading and visual material for each lecture, reading responses will be distributed in class four times throughout the quarter.

Of course today the Persian language — or \"Farsi,\" as it is also known — is most commonly associated with the nation-state of Iran. But the historical association with world literature reveals a forgotten cosmopolitanism. Before the nineteenth century, Persian served for nearly a millennium as the literary and political lingua franca across virtually the entire eastern Islamic world, including vast stretches of South, Central, and West Asia. This course will introduce students to some of the most common genres of Indo-Persian literature, such as the romantic epic (masnavi), the courtly panegyric (qasida), the quatrain (ruba‘i) and especially the lyric (ghazal), as well as to some of the canonical poets of the era and the historical context in which they lived and wrote. Expressions of love, longing, mysticism, and dissent against religious orthodoxy were among the most common themes of this literature, giving rise to its many modern afterlives — for example, in Urdu and Turkish literature, but also in European Romantic poetry, American Transcendentalist philosophy, and the music of Bollywood cinema, to name just a few. All readings will be in English or in English translation, so no prior knowledge of Persian is required for this course; but students who do have some familiarity with Persian, or with related languages like Urdu, Turkish, or Arabic, are of course most welcome to read texts in the original languages if they so desire.

From the late second millennium BCE to the eighteenth century CE, pastoral nomads emerged, often from the fringes of Eurasian civilizations, and wielding substantial military force influenced sedentary states, empires, and societies, from China to the Middle East and Europe. Beyond their military prowess, however, they also functioned as cultural agents. Sedentary people - Chinese, European, Muslim or others - portrayed them as violent intruders negatively impacting their cultures; yet nomads also facilitated and directed the exchange of goods, people, animals, religions, ideas, and technologies across civilizational boundaries, and maintained a relationship of interdependence with their settled neighbors. This course offers a comparative perspective on the role nomadic societies had in world history, spanning the early nomadic empire of the Xiongnu in nowadays Mongolia, Chinggis Khan's universal empire, the Berber Arabs of North Africa, and the Turkish armies in Asia Minor. We will explore how modern historians navigate the paucity of sources about nomads and the polities they established, and untangle narratives predominantly crafted by members of the sedentary societies."]],"o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"020941-2","r":[{"n":"Kenan Behzat Sharpe"}],"t":"Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies","k":"Pop Music, History, and the Nation","u":"MENA","n":"390-4","s":"2","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L06"],"d":"2025-04-01","e":"2025-06-07","c":"SEM","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","Course title: Pop Music, History, and the Nation Moving from the birth of recorded music and the music industry in the late 19th century all the way to the present, this class explores how popular music can be used as a source for understanding history.

The spaces in which we experience these religious phenomena are ever broadening as well. We do not experience the religious in places of worship alone but also at museums and in public buildings, on superhighways and in cyberspace.

We will study neural circuits and behavior using mutant analysis, neuroanatomical techniques, and behavioral paradigms such as courtship, aggression, and circadian and sleep behavior. We will use the fruit fly as a model system because of the amazing genetic tools available to study the fly nervous system and the conservation of basic neurobiological processes between flies and humans. During the first section of the course you will learn a variety of techniques through assigned projects. You will then design a project using the techniques learned in class, to be completed in the final weeks of the course. This will be summarized in a lab report due during finals week. NOTE 1: <strong> This course requires manual dexterity, steady hands, and good vision. You will need to handle flies while keeping them healthy, dissect their brain tissue, and troubleshoot practical problems.

Ethical and Evaluative Thinking:\n• Attain the conceptual tools needed to recognize and understand prescriptive issues, questions and claims, and to distinguish them from descriptive issues, questions, and claims: we will examine how evaluative claims (e.g., the perfection of God) were often used to underpin descriptive claims about the nature of the universe and the human mind.\n• Identify the values presupposed by an outlook or discourse: we will examine some of the central developments in early modern philosophy, as religious points of view gave rise to, as well as conflicted with, the emerging scientific perspective. • Recognize the complexity of many ethical issues and consider a variety of alternative resolutions and the reasons for holding them: we will look at a variety of ethical and evaluative issues (e.g., the problem of evil, the case for religious toleration, and the ethical foundations of personal identity), as well as their impact on broader philosophical systems. • Appreciate the insights available in one or more intellectual or cultural traditions: we will look at the intersections and divergences between various intellectual and cultural traditions, including the Reformation, the rise of early modern science, and the emergence of secularism in the Enlightenment; we will also look at how these developments appear from the point of view of some non-European philosophers. • Reflect upon one's own answers to evaluative questions, the presuppositions informing them, and the reasons supporting them: we will develop our own interpretations of, and responses to, the early modern philosophers we read, and we will develop our own views about the issues they consider, while uncovering the ways in which our presuppositions may differ from theirs.\n• Engage in respectful, rigorous, and constructive dialogue concerning evaluative issues and communicate thoughtfully and clearly about them: we will engage in a variety of individual and group activities that will foster a capacity for critical, charitable discussion, both verbally and in writing."],["Class Materials (Required)","Class materials must be purchased.

How does environmental justice relate to the values and ideals of other, more traditional forms of environmentalism? What, in turn, is its relationship—if any—to racism and other social justice issues, such as sexism and ableism?

Has the modern project of truth-seeking failed? Was it overthrown, or dismembered by the forces it unleashed? Did it run aground against certain inherent features of politics? Or is modernity alive and kicking, albeit in different shoes? In \"Modernity and Its Discontents,\" we will attempt to get to grips with these and other questions through a plethora of \"modern\" (and in some cases, \"pre-modern\" and \"post-modern\") perspectives on the relation of truth and politics.

Why do you suck at doing something as soon as you have an audience? Can humans be truly \"rational\"? We typically think of cognitive processes (e.g., thinking, deciding, recalling) as being distinct from emotional processes (e.g., feeling, expressing). However, very rarely do these processes explain human behavior in the absence of the other's influence. In this course, we will complicate our understanding of cognition and emotion by exploring some of the many real-world, everyday experiences that can only be explained at the intersection of the two processes. Through readings, in-class discussions, and out-of-class activities and exercises, we will explore a wide array of everyday phenomena (e.g., choking under pressure, lying, shopping) that span different developmental periods (e.g., childhood, adolescence, the elderly), contexts (e.g. school performance, jury duty, social media), and populations (e.g., clinical vs. nonclinical). To understand human behavior, we will take a truly interdisciplinary approach - drawing from a vast literature both within psychology (e.g., social, developmental, cognitive, political, and educational psychology) and across disciplines (e.g., law, health communications, consumer marketing). Ultimately, our discussions, readings, and exercises will equip us to better understand how and why we conduct ourselves the way we do. Course readings will include journal articles and select chapters from popular press books. There is no required textbook.

How does religion help people through experiences of horror? How does religion create and normalize horror in everyday lives? How does horror help us construct and understand the differences between \"other people\" and \"other people's religions\" and our own selves and religious worlds? This class explores these and other questions about the relationship between religion and horror. We will consider how horror as a genre can be a meaningful way for people to think through their experiences of religious trauma, and how religion has likewise been a meaningful way to heal from the horrors of war, loss, and violence. In the first half of the course, will consider how the languages of horror, monstrosity, and the unknown have been used to construct the bodies and ideologies of \"other people\" from ancient world cultures to modern ones. We will analyze how processes of fear and hate, like racism and xenophobia, draw from (and reproduce) strange and frightening constructions of religious \"others.\" We will watch movies like the 2019 hit Midommar, read monster theory, and explore the histories of giants, zombies, and vampires. The second half of the class will turn towards the self, and explore how filmmakers, authors, and theorists have used horror to think about their own religions and religious experiences. We will consider why images of violence and bloodshed are often experienced as holy within devotional practices, how love comes to be associated with sacrifice and suffering, and how bodies are marked concurrently as cites of horror, disgust, and transcendence. We will watch the 1973 classic The Exorcist, read medieval visions of hell, explore tales of hungry ghosts, spirits, and revenants, analyze encounters with demons, jinn, and dybbuks, and ask whether frightening fictionalized worlds can help people reflect on and heal from experiences of religious abuse.

The course content highlights a variety of themes, issues, figures, and narratives, while examining diverse religious practices, productions, communities, representations and identities. In this course, we dive into one of today's most exciting and rapidly growing areas of scholarship - the intriguing intersections and complex entanglements of religion and media in popular culture. Drawing from a diverse array of interdisciplinary sources, we will explore what media studies and communication theories have to offer the study of religion, and reciprocally how religious studies scholarship might enrich media studies. Our primary sources are drawn from such areas as religious television, film, and radio, digital gaming worlds, billboards, advertisements and media campaigns, popular music, comedy, streaming video, social media, memes, and even tattoos, body art, and graffiti. We will look at such areas as: how religion gets mediated; the religious dimensions of transmedia storytelling and media world-building; religion as communication; online group identity formation and religious identity construction; media representation of religions; the blurred boundaries between the so-called \"sacred and the secular\" in the study of religion and media; and controversies in overlapping religious worlds and media worlds vis-à-vis the authorized and unauthorized circulation of content. Of particular interest in this course will be the impact of digital culture on the media-religion interface. Students will be asked to research and analyze a primary source of their choice and then to make their own media to communicate their original analysis and research findings.

From foundational myths that create the space within which religion happens to discrete episodes that ground specific rituals, narratives are the very stuff of religion. The purpose of this course is to consider narratives as a special site for the production of religious meaning; the course will draw heavily from both religion theory and literary theory. Issues we will cover include: whether textual meaning is located in the author, text or reader; how the religious context of a narrative affects its possible interpretations; how myths and rituals comprise different modes of narrative; the relationship between narrative time and religious time; the challenge to authority inherent to much religious narrative; the variety of ways through which religious figures mobilize narrative to further their authority. This course will utilize Jewish and Christian narratives from the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Rabbinic Literature, Apocrypha, Gnostic Texts and Church Fathers as primary texts. Students will be expected to build on materials covered in the course by applying narrative theory to the study of these narratives. Students will also learn about the near simultaneous emergence of Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism and put these two religious formations in conversation. Some of the theoretical works to be used are: Paul Ricouer, Figuring the Sacred; Roland Barthes, Mythologies; Hayden White, \"The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Reality;\" Robert Segal, ed., The Myth and Ritual Theory; Jerome Bruner, The Making of Stories; Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics; Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures; Stanley Fish, Is There a Text in This Class?"],["Learning Objectives","1.

From those who faint at the sight of it, to those who love vampire movies and gory thrillers, to those who study and analyze it in labs, this strange substance serves as a constant source of conflict, anxiety, and ideology. Representations of blood in Christian art, literature, and theology have been just as fraught. Ancient and medieval Christians saw the substance as alternately miraculous and polluting, life-giving and death-bringing, a marker of difference and a symbol of unity. Blood had the capacity to reveal whether a person was sick or healthy, whether they were sexually active, what god they worshipped, and even whether they were guilty of murder. If it was shed on a battlefield it was considered valiant; if it was shed from the bodies of virgins or martyrs it was considered holy; if it was shed during childbirth or menstruation it was considered polluting; and if it was shed in pursuit of love it was considered romantic. The Christian language of blood and blood purity crept into developing ideas about race and sexuality, forging links between morality and embodiment that have in turn informed understandings of biology and human difference. In this class, we will explore these complex and often contradictory representations of blood and bloodshed in Christian history. By approaching this topic from a range of sources and theoretical perspectives we will use blood as a starting point for exploring broader questions about gender, religion, race, culture, and individuality.

We will explore the norming systems of religion and gender/sex/sexuality together, examining how they produce both normative and non-normative forms of embodiment and desire, while interrogating the boundaries of religion/race/ethnicity. Crucial to our study will be the examination of the language and categories of \"queer\" \"trans\" and \"religious\" as social identities and structural subject positions. Where do these terms originate and who do they include? Do they articulate forms of identity, practice, belief, or power? And how do we trace the boundaries of normativity in a transnational, transhistorical, and comparative ethnoreligious context?"]]}]},{"i":"008144","c":"WCAS","t":"TA / RA

An alternative cannon, Afrofuturism, has begun to blaze a path for understanding why the political, racial, and cultural position of those doing the imagining matters. In do so, Afrofuturism aims to inspire us to think carefully about how we deal with the pressing social issues of our time and have offered a new lens for thinking about the future. This discussion-based seminar takes this as a departure point and works towards including Latinx futurism in this frame. This seminar is an introduction to a way of thinking sociologically about technology, science, and society from the perspective of Latinx and Latin American communities.

Despite popular imagery that casts the United States as a ‘nation of immigrants', immigration has long been a contested arena of public debate, characterized by cycles of openness and xenophobia. Debates over who is worthy of being considered for inclusion in the U.S. as workers, as rights-bearing members of our communities, and potentially, as citizens, are fueled by racialized and politicized ideas of who is deserving or capable of being considered American. With a focus on post-1965 immigration trends, policies, and issues in the U.S., this course will cover how sociologists have analyzed, understood, and critiqued various immigration issues, including questions of integration, race, and belonging; national identity, assimilation, and transnationalism; lawful and unlawful entry; deportation; legalization, amnesty, asylum, and deferred action; and citizenship. Given the current political moment, we will also work together to make sense of contemporary political debates, and policies, and how they link to, or diverge from, historical patterns. Throughout, we will also consider how immigration links to key areas of power, difference, and inequality.

Service-Learning Important? In today's evolving job market, employers seek more than just engaging in classroom discussions and academic experiences; they want their workforce to make a tangible difference. Surveys from the Corporation for National and Community Service reveal that volunteering is associated with a 30% higher likelihood of employment. Companies are 80% more likely to choose candidates with volunteering experience. However, college students are less likely to volunteer compared to their parents and high school students. This seminar will explore the numerous benefits of volunteering within our local community. Through community service, students will gain real-world experience and develop valuable skills while making a positive impact on others' lives. Working with nonprofit organizations provides first-year students an excellent opportunity to explore career paths and enhance their time-management skills. Additionally, college students who volunteer in their local communities often feel happier and experience a greater sense of belonging. Students are required to complete an 8-hour community volunteering project."],["Learning Objectives","•\tApply service-learning instruction to address real-life problems.\n•\tArticulate and demonstrate teamwork and leadership skills.\n•\tDiscuss community work experiences through written essays and digital media.\n•\tIntegrate classroom learning and course content with civic engagement.\n•\tIdentify, assess, and become aware of the issues, needs, and social policies of various communities in Evanston, Chicago, and surrounding areas"],["Evaluation Method","Class participation is 10%.

We will examine a diverse array of texts - poetry, novels, short stories, films, videos, memoir, and critical essays - produced in both Spanish and English both in the Caribbean and in the United States by writers of Puerto Rican, Dominican and Cuban origin. As we read, we will use exile, migration, and diaspora as lenses through which to interrogate other aspects of Latinx Caribbean cultural production. How are these experiences portrayed, and what role have they played in the construction of identities, both personal and collective? How have these situations shaped the development of Caribbean communities (both physical and literary) within the continental U.S.? Should these movements be seen as patterns connected to globalization, thus serving to complicate our idea of what is Caribbean, or can they in fact be understood as fundamental to the construction of Caribbean-ness? We will look at how exile, migration, and diaspora relate to - and help shape -- the treatment of race and gender in these works, and we will analyze the role of nostalgia and humor in the navigation of different cultural and geographic spaces."],["Learning Objectives","Students will be introduced to theoretical writing about the formation and nature of \"The Caribbean\" as a region both real and imagined. They will gain a knowledge of some of the issues explored in Cuban, Dominican, and Puerto Rican writing of the 20th and 21st centuries, and they will be introduced to a variety of written and cinematic Caribbean texts from this period. Three writing assignments (2 short position papers and a longer conference-length essay) will allow them to practice their academic writing."],["Class Materials (Required)","•\tYoss.
