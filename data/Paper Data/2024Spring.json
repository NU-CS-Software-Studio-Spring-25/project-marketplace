We will think about personal listening habits, the 'soundtracking' of everyday life, and the uses of music for emotional management. We will also consider changes in musical taste from hierarchical aesthetics based on high/low distinctions to forms of 'omnivorous' listening. We'll consider how these changes in aesthetics have impacted concert music institutions and produced more permeable boundary between commercial genres and traditionally classical ensembles.

In this course we will review the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in the last forty years and apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire. This combination of theoretical inquiry and practical application of analytical methods is reflected in the course design, in which in-class discussion of readings will be followed by analytical exercises. The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussions, one presentation and two analytical papers."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the class the student will be expected to have become familiar with the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in recent decades and learned how to apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbooks required."]]}]},{"i":"003733","c":"MUSIC","t":"Selected Topics in Music Theory","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"435-0","s":[{"i":"003733-1","r":[{"n":"Richard D Ashley","p":"847/491-5720","a":"r-ashley@northwestern.edu","o":"W 10-11 and by appt.","b":"Professor, music theory and cognition program.

Students are expected to listen to each piece and be able to provide appropriate tempos for all movements and works being studied. From your listening you will also be expected to have an awareness of orchestration and the appropriate style. In addition, you will be expected to know which sections are solo or soli in any complete piece being studied."],["Teaching Method","This is a performance class. Each week, students enrolled in the class will play 2-3 different excerpts for the class, receiving feedback from the professor as well as students in the class. You are welcome to use repertoire lists for upcoming or past professional auditions, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the New World Symphony, summer festivals, or graduate school auditions. There should be a mix of styles, composers, and difficulty so that you gather a list of excerpts that reflects what an audition committee would need to hear; excerpts that demonstrate the skills needed by an orchestral flutist/piccolo player. (If performing an excerpt that has previously been learned, please memorize the excerpt as a new way of working on it.) We will hold a mock audition at the end of the quarter. In the mock audition, playing for your peers will help to simulate a live audition experience."],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be determined as follows:\nPerformance in weekly class: 50 %\nListening/score study: 10%\nMock audition performance: 30 %\nOverall contribution to the class environment: 10%"],["Class Materials (Required)","Students are not required to purchase a specific excerpt book.

(No permission number applies.)"],["Learning Objectives","The main objective is to gather the skills and knowledge needed to take professional auditions. Students are expected to listen to each piece and be able to provide appropriate tempos for all movements and works being studied. From your listening you will also be expected to have an awareness of orchestration and the appropriate style. In addition, you will be expected to know which sections are solo or soli in any complete piece being studied."],["Teaching Method","This is a performance class. Each week, students enrolled in the class will play 2-3 different excerpts for the class, receiving feedback from the professor as well as students in the class. You are welcome to use repertoire lists for upcoming or past professional auditions, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the New World Symphony, summer festivals, or graduate school auditions. There should be a mix of styles, composers, and difficulty so that you gather a list of excerpts that reflects what an audition committee would need to hear; excerpts that demonstrate the skills needed by an orchestral flutist/piccolo player. (If performing an excerpt that has previously been learned, please memorize the excerpt as a new way of working on it.) We will hold a mock audition at the end of the quarter. In the mock audition, playing for your peers will help to simulate a live audition experience."],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be determined as follows:\nPerformance in weekly class: 50 %\nListening/score study: 10%\nMock audition performance: 30 %\nOverall contribution to the class environment: 10%"],["Class Materials (Required)","Students are not required to purchase a specific excerpt book.

Specific topics for study and analysis include the foundational doctrines of original Indian title; inherent tribal sovereignty; congressional plenary authority over American Indian affairs; and the federal trust duty to protect American Indian lands and rights. These doctrines' impact on the contemporary lives, resources, cultures, and rights of the American Indian peoples will be evaluated within selected legal frameworks. Federal Indian law is of obvious relevance to those students with an interest in our indigenous nations and their populations. Less obvious, however, is the importance of rulings in the field for law more broadly defined. For example, Chief Justice John Marshall's opinions in the so-called Cherokee cases of the early 1800s were foundational in determining the obligation of states to abide by decisions of the Supreme Court. Further, understanding Federal Indian law is crucial for any lawyer who represents a tribe or advises investors whose capital is to be connected, even if only in a tenuous way, with a federally recognized tribe. After covering the foundational material, this course examines in greater depth selected specialized areas such as: civil and criminal jurisdiction within Indian country; missing and murdered indigenous women; environmental law; taxation; cultural and religious freedoms; child welfare law; gaming; economic development; reserved water rights; food sovereignty; cultural sovereignty; and hunting and fishing rights. The areas to be covered will be determined early in the first half of the course."],["Class Materials (Required)","Robert Anderson, Bethany Berger, Sarah Krakoff, American Indian Law: Cases and Commentary 4th ed.

Students work under the supervision of attorneys in these offices and conduct research, write briefs and memoranda, interview clients and witnesses, participate in community education efforts, and assist attorneys in trial preparation and trial. Students secure their own placement in consultation with the faculty member before the semester starts."],["Learning Objectives","Ideally, if you participate fully and actively in the Public Interest Practicum, you will: (1) Expand your knowledge in particular areas of substantive law, including: the particular areas of law covered at your externship (e.g. employment discrimination), the scarcity of legal services for the poor, the range of legal issues faced by low-income persons, important topics such as race and trauma, and issues in professional responsibility; (2) Improve on a variety of skills: legal (depending on placement and including research, writing, analysis, fact gathering, interviewing, identifying causes of action, case strategy, drafting, and oral advocacy and presentation) and other professional skills (including receiving and understanding assignments, figuring out how to prioritize work, time management, meeting deadlines, learning from feedback, and communication with supervisors); (3) Gain a better understanding of yourself (by identifying successes and areas for improvement and starting to develop and apply new strategies through self-reflection in journals, class discussions, and meetings with supervisors and faculty); and (4) Explore and start planning for who you want to be as a lawyer doing what and where."],["Evaluation Method","The final grade will be based on approximately these components and the more detailed descriptions that follow: (1) 20% 1st journal installment; (2) 20% 2nd journal installment; (3) 10% journal on which you do the best; (4) 25% class workshop; and (5) 25% class attendance and participation. You will write reflective journal entries analyzing your work experiences and different class topics and responding to prompts. You will submit your journal two times over the course of the semester. After you hand in the 1st journal installment, I will provide you with feedback to help you improve on your 2nd journal installment. You will give a workshop to the class on a topic of your choosing towards the end of the semester. As part of the workshop, you will present your research on that particular topic in an engaging, interactive way and facilitate a brief discussion. Class attendance and participation will be graded based on efforts, not on whether answers are right or wrong. In addition, successful compliance with the externship requirements and the expectations of your placement supervisor are essential. Although the field placement experience will not be graded directly, I will be in contact with your supervisor during the semester to discuss your work. Failure to comply with the requirements and expectations of your externship may have an impact on your grade. You will get individual feedback and guidance from me on your journals, workshop topic and outline, and anything else that relates to the class through conferences during the semester, and you can meet with me more, as needed."],["Class Materials (Required)","All course materials will be provided on Canvas.

(NOTE: This has sometimes been taught as a seminar, but this year it will be a more traditional class.) More specifically, we will focus most of our attention on the issues raised today by internet platforms, such as their dominance of certain markets, their acquisition and use of enormous amounts of consumer data (that is, privacy regulation), and their potential for serious effects on our speech ecosystems (such as their carrying false information and their alleged discrimination against certain individuals and viewpoints). Should Google be broken up? Should Amazon? Should social media be subject to nondiscrimination rules (as Texas law currently provides)? Should privacy regulation be enhanced? Should Section 230 immunities for hosting user-generated content (even very toxic content) be limited? To address these and other questions, the course covers both the history and theory of communications regulation and the communications industry, broadly speaking. While we are in a new era of communications, dominated by several of the world's most valuable companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba, and Facebook), many of these policy questions have strong historical precedents. In addition to questions of internet policy, this course will provide the tools to understand a vast swath of regulation: historic, current, and potential. A significant number of industries have been regulated in the same manner as telecommunications, including railroads, electricity, airlines, natural gas, and others. Some of these industries are today completely deregulated and some only partially. But the regulation debate has (and will) include expansion as well as contraction, and industries such as pharmaceuticals, health care, education, and local transportation (think ridesharing) are all subject of a vigorous debate over regulation. The lessons from telecommunications and internet regulation apply to these debates as well."],["Registration Requirements","There are no prerequisites for the course, and students do not need to have any technical background - just an interest in studying the appropriate policy responses to these hard issues."],["Evaluation Method","The class grade will depend on a combination of class participation, a brief mid-semester reaction paper, and a final exam."]]}]},{"i":"021709","c":"LAW","t":"Human Trafficking","u":"CONPUB","n":"735","s":[{"i":"021709-1","r":[{"n":"Carrie E Hamilton"}],"t":"Human Trafficking","u":"CONPUB","n":"735","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":20}],"l":["McCormick 375 - Smith Hall"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"SEM","a":25,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"023548","c":"LAW","t":"Reproductive Justice Seminar","u":"CONPUB","n":"758","s":[{"i":"023548-1","r":[{"n":"Deborah Tuerkheimer","p":"312/503-4864","a":"LM 301"}],"t":"Reproductive Justice Seminar","u":"CONPUB","n":"758","s":"1","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":35}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":25}],"l":["McCormick 381 - Cutting Hall"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"SEM","a":25}]},{"i":"023559","c":"LAW","t":"Originalism: Theory and Practice","u":"CONPUB","n":"762","s":[{"i":"023559-1","r":[{"n":"John O McGinnis","p":"312/503-3235","a":"RB229; j-mcginnis@law.northwestern.edu"}],"t":"Originalism: Theory and Practice","u":"CONPUB","n":"762","s":"1","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":20}],"l":["McCormick 375 - Smith Hall"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"SEM","a":20}]},{"i":"024302","c":"LAW","t":"Constitutional Controversy in the Public Arena","u":"CONPUB","n":"765","s":[{"i":"024302-1","r":[{"n":"Jason C DeSanto","p":"312/503-2651","a":"McCormick 198","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Constitutional Controversy in the Public Arena","u":"CONPUB","n":"765","s":"1","m":["34"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":25}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["McCormick 371"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"LEC","a":25,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"023663","c":"LAW","t":"The Regulation of Money in Politics","u":"CONPUB","n":"775","s":[{"i":"023663-1","r":[{"n":"Michael Seokhyun Kang"}],"t":"The Regulation of Money in Politics","u":"CONPUB","n":"775","s":"1","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":20}],"l":["McCormick 375 - Smith Hall"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"SEM","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","This seminar explores the cutting-edge issues in the regulation of money in politics and government.

By the end of the course, you will (1) understand legal requirements pertaining to workplace discrimination and harassment investigations; (2) identify and draft legally defensible workplace nondiscrimination policies and investigation processes; (3) learn how to effectively plan an investigation from the receipt of the complaint and draft an investigation plan; (4) learn how to interview key parties in the investigation including the complainant, respondent, and witnesses, make credibility determinations, and draft interview memorandums; (5) draft an investigation report that details your factual findings, makes determinations regarding culpability and credibility, and provides recommendations regarding discipline and corporate systemic changes. Throughout the semester we will consider the many challenges that face internal and external investigators, common pitfalls in investigations, and the (often conflicting) interests of stakeholders. Thorough, objective internal investigators who can write objective, accurate, legally defensible reports are in high demand. This area of the law offers many opportunities for individuals who are interested in employment law but not litigation. Throughout the semester you will write a number of relatively short (1-5 pages) ungraded assignments designed to build your knowledge in this area of law, build an investigation record, and ultimately help you craft a thorough, graded investigation report. Canvas will be our hub for the course. Your reading and writing assignments will be detailed on each week's module's instruction page. Please review Canvas regularly. Please note, this course will regularly include content regarding discrimination and harassment, including race and sexual harassment.

They might advocate for youth in juvenile court, on appeal, in collateral matters, and/or in clemency proceedings. As part of a national litigation effort following the groundbreaking 2012 U. S. Supreme Court decision in Miller v. Alabama (which banned mandatory life sentences for youth), students might also represent individuals in post-conviction and resentencing proceedings, who were given lengthy or life sentences for offenses that occurred when they were in their youth. They may also draft amicus briefs to state appellate and supreme courts. Students may also collaborate with statewide and national partners on research and policy initiatives related to the extreme sentencing of youth and emerging adults. Students will have the opportunity to develop traditional trial skills as well as skills related to negotiation, investigation, discovery, expert witness preparation, client counseling, written advocacy, and policy reform. Additionally, as work in this clinic intersects with national, statewide, and local activism and conversations occurring around race/structural racism, policing, and prosecution, students can expect readings and discussions exploring the structural forces and trends behind the law in this area as well as social science research regarding adolescent development, public health approaches to violence, the benefits of holistic representation, and the implementation of restorative justice practices.

With increasing frequency, governments are using taxes as part of the toolkit to address climate change and other environmental pressures. Environmental taxes are a market instrument used to influence taxpayer action. Environmental taxes can impose a tax cost on certain products or activities that may be environmentally damaging, or they can give a tax benefit to something viewed as environmentally beneficial. All types of taxes—income taxes, estate and wealth taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes—potentially can incorporate environmental tax measures. Such taxes can be imposed at the local, state, or federal level, and are also employed by many governments around the world. Environmental taxes will not necessarily replace traditional environmental regulation. In some instances, they may complement regulation, and in others they may provide an option when regulation is not appropriate. In some cases, taxes can have a negative environmental effect by exacerbating environmental externalities. In addition, tax advisors are playing a greater role in helping taxpayers address environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") considerations and disclosure requirements, in part because of the burgeoning number of environmental taxes, but also because of the tax and accounting functions' role in complying with mandatory disclosure requirements and voluntary reporting of ESG metrics. In this course, students will: •\tExamine theories of environmental taxation, and consider the role of tax law in addressing environmental and sustainability concerns more generally, including in regards to supporting private sector efforts towards sustainability and meeting ESG-related goals. •\tConsider the role of market-based environmental instruments among the array of environmental policy instruments, including command-and-control regulation. •\tCompare environmental taxation strategies throughout the world, including recently-enacted U.S. tax credits and other \"green\" expenditures, as well as various carbon tax instruments. •\tDevelop skills in reading and writing about technical statutory language and tax rules and regulations."]]}]},{"i":"015544","c":"LAW","t":"Advanced Taxation of Property Transactions","u":"TAXLAW","n":"641","s":[{"i":"015544-1","r":[{"n":"Genevieve Anne Tokic"}],"t":"Advanced Taxation of Property Transactions","u":"TAXLAW","n":"641","s":"1","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff Building 339"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"LEC","a":59,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Basic Tax OR LLM Tax"}]},{"i":"018785","c":"LAW","t":"Taxation of Structured Real Estate Transactions","u":"TAXLAW","n":"642","s":[{"i":"018785-1","r":[{"n":"Daniel Francis Cullen"},{"n":"Peter Raymond Matejcak"},{"n":"Suk Bae Gong"}],"t":"Taxation of Structured Real Estate Transactions","u":"TAXLAW","n":"642","s":"1","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":20}],"l":["Rubloff Building 339"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Basic Tax OR LLM Tax"}]},{"i":"019560","c":"LAW","t":"European Union Taxation","u":"TAXLAW","n":"643","s":[{"i":"019560-1","r":[{"n":"Maria Amparo Grau Ruiz","p":"312 503 1996","a":"LM 287","o":"12:00 - 2:00 PM Thu"}],"t":"European Union Taxation","u":"TAXLAW","n":"643","s":"1","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["McCormick 381 - Cutting Hall"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"SEM","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Basic Tax OR LLM Tax"}]},{"i":"019561","c":"LAW","t":"Taxation of Debt Instruments and other Financial Transactions","u":"TAXLAW","n":"644","s":[{"i":"019561-1","r":[{"n":"Mennatallah Ahmed Eltaki"},{"n":"Richard G Larkins"}],"t":"Taxation of Debt Instruments and other Financial Transactions","u":"TAXLAW","n":"644","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":20}],"l":["Rubloff Building 140"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"SEM","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Basic Tax OR LLM Tax"}]},{"i":"015550","c":"LAW","t":"Estate Planning","u":"TAXLAW","n":"651","s":[{"i":"015550-1","r":[{"n":"Kim Alison Kamin"}],"t":"Estate Planning","u":"TAXLAW","n":"651","s":"1","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":20}],"l":["McCormick 185 - Sidley Hall"],"d":"2024-01-08","e":"2024-04-17","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Basic Tax OR LLM Tax","p":[["Overview of class","This course will review the basics of the transfer tax system and then cover various estate planning techniques used by sophisticated tax practitioners to reduce or eliminate the transfer tax burden of transferring wealth and to implement a client's other estate planning goals.

We will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic.

The objective of this course to address five fundamental questions namely, (1) how is thermal energy distributed among electrons and phonons? (2) how fast do the carriers move through a material? (3) how much thermal energy do each carrier hold? (4) how do the carriers scatter as they move through a material?, and (5) how do the carriers interact with material boundaries and interfaces? The answers to these questions will provide a basis for understanding the conduction of thermal energy in solid-state nanomaterials, and the design and control of thermal processes in heat-transfer, thermoelectric, thermionic, thermophotovoltaic devices and solar cells. In the classroom, I will introduce the Landauer transport formalism and use it to elucidate the fundamental limits of heat conduction between two contacts/reservoirs by electrons and phonons, and to explain the dependence of thermal conductance on energy, frequency, wavelength, and material size. Homework problem sets will be assigned to facilitate deep learning of the course material and journal article reviews will be used to highlight new thermophysical insights on heat conduction in 1D and 2D nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes, nanowires, graphene, molecular junctions, etc."],["Registration Requirements","Prerequisite: ME 377 (Heat transfer) and ME 222 (Thermodynamics)."],["Evaluation Method","Paper review and presentations"],["Class Materials (Suggested)","Supplemental References:\n• Nanoscale Energy Transport and Conversion: A Parallel.

What is involved in transforming a community from one that is low-income to high income? What are the positives and negatives of gentrification? In both teamed and individual research, this class will look at the economics, sociology and humanity of changing neighborhoods, using Chicago, one of the most fascinating cities in the world, as a primary source."],["Registration Requirements","Pre-reqs: JOUR 201-1, JOUR 201-2, sophomore standing"],["Class Materials (Required)","None"]]},{"i":"000930-30","r":[{"n":"Abigail M Foerstner"}],"t":"Journalism in Practice","k":"Environmental Reporting in a High Stakes Climate","u":"JOUR","n":"301-0","s":"30","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":30}],"l":["Fisk Hall 308"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LAB","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Medill Sophomores, Juniors & Seniors Pre-req: JOUR 201-1, 201-2, and Medill sophomore, Junior, or Senior Standing.","p":[["Overview of class","Tackle what's at stake as our communities confront climate change, lead leaching from water mains, outdated oil pipelines, drought, flooding, and health risks resulting from contaminants and environmental injustice.

Do robot waiters and jockeys have rights? How are digital scandals around the body rooted in histories of nation-building? What are ethics in the world of the digital and how are they shaped? This course emphasizes transnational scholarship to consider the ways that we learn to live with digital media, exploring the way that systems of culture and power shape our moral dilemmas online. We will investigate several questions, such as: How do we consider charges against public decency, family values, and morality, which shape online controversies in the Global South and the MENA region? What is the place of scandal or the sacred in the realm of the digital? What forms of invisible labor shape our relationship to social media? What are the mechanics of surveillance and how do they relate to persisting global power asymmetries? What is the role of technology corporations in shaping our digital media landscape, considering an increasing reliance on digital media to help us navigate the world and even tell us about our own bodies? This course explores locally situated questions of ethics, considering their tension with ideas of the universal. It also examines the role of states, technology platforms, and corporations in shaping these landscapes of acceptability. Students will learn how to engage in media critique about issues related to digital media, apply case studies to course concepts, and situate ethical issues within their sociohistorical and political contexts. </p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None </li>\n<li>Open to First-year students and sophomores </li>\n</li>"]]}]},{"i":"024652","c":"DOHA","t":"Introduction to Gender Studies","u":"INTERDIS","n":"206-0","s":[{"i":"024652-70","r":[{"n":"Haya Gabr Al-Noaimi"}],"t":"Introduction to Gender Studies","u":"INTERDIS","n":"206-0","s":"70","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":3,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":4,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 2-258"],"d":"2024-01-07","e":"2024-04-25","c":"SEM","a":23,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Seats are reserved for Sophomore and Freshmen only."}]},{"i":"024294","c":"DOHA","t":"Geopolitics & the Global South","u":"INTERDIS","n":"305-0","s":[{"i":"024294-70","r":[{"n":"Mufid Ahmad Qassoum"}],"t":"Geopolitics & the Global South","u":"INTERDIS","n":"305-0","s":"70","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":1,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 1-245"],"d":"2024-01-07","e":"2024-04-25","c":"LEC","a":23,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for NU Qatar Juniors and Seniors Only","p":[["Overview of class","<p>China announced its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 as a grand strategy of connectivity through networked land and sea routes.

This course approaches digital artifacts as cultural objects on the Internet which require retooled interpretive frameworks. We will answer questions like: What can search results tell us about power? How is Twitter a racial artifact? Why do user-generated videos of an event change the way it is understood. Digital media texts require approaches which recognize changes in practices of reading, analysis, and interpretation. At the same time, they are connected to historical forms like the bulletin board, the satellite image, and political cartoons in newspapers. This course therefore takes both a historical and semiotic approach to the study of digital media to situate the objects that we engage with daily—hashtags, selfies, search results, image filters, and memes—along a longer history of media forms. In doing so, it grapples with questions of epistemology—how we know what we know—prompted by global changes. By approaching digital artifacts in these ways, it shows how imaginaries of what they are shape our understandings of visibility, sociality, and power. The course will teach students how to conduct media critique, to peer review in class workshops, and to critically access changes in the digital media landscape.</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: MIT 220-0\n<li>Open to sophomores and above, MIT majors only </li>\n<li>Open for cross registration </li>\n<li>Satisfies Media and Politics Minor</li>\n</ul>"]]}]},{"i":"019587","c":"DOHA","t":"History of Film","u":"MIT","n":"312-0","s":[{"i":"019587-70","r":[{"n":"Michael Scott Curtis"}],"t":"History of Film","u":"MIT","n":"312-0","s":"70","m":["1","3"],"x":[{"h":6,"m":30},{"h":6,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":7,"m":45},{"h":9,"m":30}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 1-244","Northwestern Qatar Room G-337"],"d":"2024-01-07","e":"2024-04-25","c":"LEC","a":23,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Seats are reserved for sophomores & above who have completed MIT 220-0","p":[["Overview of class","<p>This course surveys the global film history from the 1890s to the present, examining national industrial, social, and historical contexts within which films were produced and viewed as theories of cinema emerged alongside them.

From novels and movies in the 1930s featuring teen sleuth Nancy Drew to contemporary films and TV shows such as Whip It, Wadjda, and That's So Raven, girls' media artifacts have functioned as important historical sites for the negotiation of cultural politics and youthful feminine ideals. In order to shed light on the often-overlooked history of girls' media, this course offers a critical investigation of (primarily) U.S. girls' media from the 1930s to the present, including novels, films, TV shows, advertisements, music videos, teen magazines, toys, and new media. We will investigate girls' media artifacts as aesthetic, political, and commercial texts through which youth have interfaced with lessons about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, national identity, and generation at different historical moments. Although American commercial media will be taken up as our main object of study, students will have opportunities to explore media made outside the U.S. in their own research projects, and we will consider girls' independent production and reception practices in both Western and non-Western contexts. Ultimately, the goals of the course are: 1) to explore the dominant strategies utilized by the media industries to represent female youth and their concerns, as well as those utilized by girls in practices of self-representation; 2) to examine girls' reception of and diverse engagements with media; and 3) to consider how the landscape of girls' media production and consumption has changed, and resisted change, over time.\"</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None </li>\n<li>Open to Sophomores and above, MIT majors only </li>\n</li>"]]},{"i":"021975-71","r":[{"n":"Shehram Mokhtar"}],"t":"Film, Media & Gender","k":"Gender in Film","u":"MIT","n":"325-0","s":"71","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":8,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":15}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 2-257"],"d":"2024-01-07","e":"2024-04-25","c":"LEC","a":23,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Seats are reserved for sophomores & above who have completed MIT 220-0 Registration is reserved for NU Qatar COMM students.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>This course explores how the issues of gender are integral to understand and analyze film form or moving images.

How can our thinking about something affect the nature of the things we think about? What are the historical developments and social forces at work? Does the claim that something is socially constructed mean that it is not real? We are also going to think about the political and ethical implications of the idea: Does the claim that something is socially constructed undermine its authority? What is the problem with essentialists claims about race, gender, disability, etc.? Does social construction mean that \"anything goes\"? What should we do with the things that turn out to be socially constructed -- keep, reform, or abolish them? We are going to explore these question in a number of different areas, which may include race, gender, sexuality, disability, mental illness, money, and power.

Taking a deep dive into The Wizard of Oz, The Wiz, and Wicked (and dipping our toes into the wide range of Oz adaptations across U.S. popular culture), we will explore how adaptive practices and musical theatre form can reinforce, exploit, challenge, and change the artistic, social, and cultural conventions that shape—and are shaped by—this iconic American story as it is retold time and again."],["Registration Requirements","Enrollment is restricted to SoC undergraduate first year students."],["Learning Objectives","1.To deepen understanding about, and encourage enthusiasm for, research related to diversity. 2.To learn about how scholars from different disciplines examine scientific questions, including the varied methods they use in the process. 3.To engage with scholars from across SoC, including through thoughtful in-class questions and discussion. 4.To consider the many different aspects of the field for communication could be examined and understood and even what cross-disciplinary collaboration might look like."]]}]},{"i":"004331","c":"SPCH","t":"School of Communication EPICS Internship Analysis","u":"CMN","n":"300-0","s":[{"i":"004331-1","r":[{"n":"Laura Ellen Myers"}],"t":"School of Communication EPICS Internship Analysis","u":"CMN","n":"300-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"FLD","a":15}]},{"i":"004368","c":"SPCH","t":"School of Communication EPICS Internship Seminar","u":"CMN","n":"340-0","s":[{"i":"004368-20","r":[{"n":"Kathryn Holst Test"}],"t":"School of Communication EPICS Internship Seminar","u":"CMN","n":"340-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":19,"m":0}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 1483"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"FLD","a":15},{"i":"004368-40","r":[{"n":"Kathryn Holst Test"}],"t":"School of Communication EPICS Internship Seminar","k":"Extra Credit","u":"CMN","n":"340-0","s":"40","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"FLD","a":100}]},{"i":"024451","c":"SPCH","t":"Module Capstone","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":[{"i":"024451-1","r":[{"n":"Spencer W Parsons"},{"n":"Detra Rachelle Payne"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Acting for the Screen","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-2","r":[{"n":"Elizabeth Spencer Norton"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Children & Communication","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"2","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-3","r":[{"n":"Eliza Bent"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Comedy Arts","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"3","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-4","r":[{"n":"Alexander Cesare Gemignani"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Creating the Musical","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"4","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-5","r":[{"n":"Jeremy P Birnholtz"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Digital Media","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"5","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-6","r":[{"n":"Jeff Clayton Brown"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Directing for the Screen","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"6","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-7","r":[{"n":"Nathan Walter"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Health Communication","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"7","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-8","r":[{"n":"Larissa Buchholz"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Media & Creative Markets","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"8","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-9","r":[{"n":"Ozge Samanci","p":"847/467-0483","a":"AMS 213"}],"t":"Module Capstone","k":"Media Arts & Game Design","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"9","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-10","t":"Module Capstone","k":"Performance and Activism","u":"CMN","n":"370-0","s":"10","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"PRA","a":20},{"i":"024451-11","r":[{"n":"Laura J.

We will discuss how these elements can be applied and how you can leverage them to change thoughts, attitudes, and behavior more effectively. The course and assignments are structured to help you think about the mechanisms associated with ‘sticky' messages and complete a research paper where you dissect a message of your choosing. At the same time, you will learn critical steps in constructing an argument supported by research, from defending a claim, planning and outlining, drafting, and peer editing.

And yet the idea of an individual creator still has a powerful hold over the way most of us think about and experience the media. What does it mean to be an \"author\" in the creative industries? What is the nature of creative work? How are artistic reputations constructed and understood? What role do critics and audiences play in that process? Why so some media texts have authors and others don't? How does collaboration work in the creative industries? In this course we will investigate these and other questions through the analysis of the transmedia career of David Lynch. Instead of writing research papers, students will engage with Lynch's career by making videoessays using Adobe Premiere. As such, this course will be a hands-on introduction to the videographic essay as a mode of media analysis. Students will undertake several exercises in video editing with the goal of developing an audiovisual analysis of Lynch's work. The course will serve as an introduction to basic video editing skills, and no previous experience in editing is required. Lynch's output covers a remarkably wide range of production contexts and media forms, encompassing visual art, film, television, photography, furniture design, popular music, online films, digital cinematography, and virtual reality. Lynch has occupied a wide range of positions in the field of cultural production, moving moved from underground cult filmmaker to the creator of a hit network television series (\"Twin Peaks\") and winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Starting his career as a painter, he emerged as an avant-garde filmmaker in the early 1970s. After his first feature Eraserhead achieved the status of a cult classic on the \"midnight movie\" circuit, Lynch jumped into mainstream filmmaking, and has become one of the rare directors to find success with general audiences, cult fans, and academics. Films such as Blue Velvet became touchstones for film theorists during the 1980s, and are still discussed in academic circles today. Lynch has never been without his critics, and his work has come under fire for its depiction of women, sexual violence, race, and class. Lynch has often had creative control over his projects, and yet his distinctive \"Lynchian\" signature was forged through long-standing collaborative relationships with a cohort of actors, composers, editors, casting directors, costume designers, and sound designers. Lynch is thus a remarkably fertile case study for a consideration of media authorship, modes of collaboration in the creative industries, the history of film culture since the 1970s, the various logics of film, television, and digital media production, the importance of sound design in audio-visual media, the representation of race, class, and gender, and a range of other issues."],["Evaluation Method","Students will be assessed through: 1) several short response papers; 2) several videographic essays made using Adobe Premiere; 3) in-class reading quizzes; 4) a critical review of the \"Twin Peaks\" VR experience."],["Class Materials (Required)","Chris Rodley ed., Lynch on Lynch\nBernard Pomerance, The Elephant Man: A Play Other readings available on Canvas."]],"o":"6"},{"i":"004353-21","r":[{"n":"Miriam B White"}],"t":"Radio/Tv/Film Authorship","k":"Women Directors","u":"RTVF","n":"321-0","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annie May Swift Hall 109"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","This class will focus on films directed by women that are about women artists, especially authors and painters.

But in the late 2010s, a trio of otherwise unrelated projects pulled the genre deep into the darkness at the heart of the American landscape. In so doing, these three games took their places in a long tradition of American Gothic fiction, carried on from figures like Edgar Allan Poe and Flannery O'Connor. Three scenarios: a young woman returns to her Rust Belt hometown to find that the friends she left behind have moved on in their lives and that secrets lurk in the mines. A truck driver searches the backwoods of Kentucky for the mysterious Route Zero. A man goes missing among the androids and alligators in the industrial sprawl outside New Orleans. In this class we will be playing three games: Night in the Woods (Infinite Fall, 2017), Kentucky Route Zero (Cardboard Computer, 2020), and NORCO (Geography of Robots, 2022). As we discuss these games, we will put them in conversation with additional readings from and surveying the American Gothic literary tradition. This will be a reading- and writing-heavy course: class meetings will consist of discussion of games and readings, and assignments will generally take the form of written responses and critical essays. You will be expected to play the three primary games we will be discussing to completion. The games in question are thematically challenging rather than mechanically challenging. They require little in the way of quick thinking or precision reflexes, and mostly involve reading text and solving puzzles.

The goal of the voice section of this class is to develop both the actor's speaking voice to communicate with an audience both for stage, film, tv and audio performances and to free the actor's body with the goal of developing a performer's ability to move and speak at the same time freely and without tension. Movement puts us in the present moment. Sensing through our bodies is how we can function, perceive, relate, and react to people and things in our environment. As performers, the way you embody a character or a role is essential to be able to accurately portray a whole person, and for you to create a whole other life within your bodymind. Taking care of your body is an invaluable and lifelong process that takes time, consistency, and practice. In the movement section of this course, you will learn the fundamentals of embodiment, or how to both feel and express through your body. By learning anatomical connections of the breath and musculoskeletal system, practicing detailed movement exercises, engaging in sensory awareness meditations, and playing physical games with your peers, you will gain an introductory knowledge of how your body functions and how to move expressively and effectively on stage.

We will also consider how the classroom is a colonized space, and develop learning strategies and outcomes informed by our developing understanding of what \"decolonization\" is. That is to say, there will be no tests or traditional final essays; students will have the agency to determine, in consultation with the instructor, some course content and how they wish to demonstrate proficiency with course objectives.

The second part is a production class which will run in the spring (likely Thursdays 11am-150pm). Four plays from part one of the class will be selected to receive workshop productions in part two. This will culminate in a weekend festival in June where the produced plays will be showcased. In addition to second and third year graduate directors, this class is open to undergraduate Junior and Senior advanced directing students by permission only.

As we move through the quarter, we will draw on this framework to analyze human judgment and organizational decisionmaking in medicine, public health, criminal justice, sports, and social media. We will investigate ways to use insights from research to improve the functioning of organizations, with a goal of making life better for the people that work in them and the people they serve. Importantly, we will also consider the limitations of the cognitivist perspectives of Tversky and Kahneman and will explore embodied and extended views of the mind developed by modern-day researchers.

Learning happens in social and cultural practices, be they practices affiliated with cultural communities, academic disciplines, or professional and interest-based domains. Many of these practices are also taking place in online, global and intercultural contexts where people bring diverse experiences to the process of cultural production and learning. This course provides a critical introduction to the social and cultural dimensions of learning, with a particular focus on how language and diverse tools and modes of expression mediate forms of identity, learning experiences, and participation in and transformation of social life. We will engage with ways of conceptualizing and studying the relation of culture, language and identity, interrogate existing borders, binaries and hierarchies, and consider learning in the contexts of demographic diversity, transnational migration, media flows and youth cultures. An important goal of this course is to explore how linguistic and cultural diversity can provide generative resources for learning and education. Traditional schools and classrooms tend to draw from a limited range of resources for learning. This is reflected in the literature and content that are used, and the expectations for how people interact and communicate with each other. Such restricted curriculum contributes to the fact that many students' experiences are being marginalized from schooling, and students' having difficulty identifying with what they are expected to learn (cf. Martinez, Morales & Aldana, 2017). In this class, we will read studies that tackle these issues, which are both social scientific and political issues. We will also consider new ways to think about and design learning environments that draw from and build on a diverse range of knowledge, language and cultural resources for learning - resources that are more reflective of the experiences of our students. Through the class readings, materials and discussions, we will venture into diverse settings across community, school, and new media environments.

Skilled educators continually take experiences from the field in the form of observations, curiosities, and challenges to inform structured inquiry—with the purpose of improving conceptual and pedagogical understandings for themselves and their students. MSED 407-1 and 407-2 are grounded in a model of action research. In our view, action research is not distinct from the work of teaching and educating, rather when done well it drives the work of teaching and learning. Data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings on a daily basis—we are responsible for mining and learning from them. As a result of these courses you will not only have designed and conducted action research— your Master's Project —but more importantly, you will have a set of stances and tools to embark on a career as an educator scholar who continues to notice various aspects of teaching and learning, ask important questions, and engage in meaningful, guided examinations of practice to evolve learning. The goal of MSED 407-1 and 407-2 is to help you become informed educators who are able to turn curiosities and challenges from your settings into potential areas of structured reflection and research. The basis of the course is the model of action research — of studying our own settings around questions we are passionate about, for the purpose of improving our students and colleagues learning as well as our own practice. Action research is not distinct from the work of teaching, rather the data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings daily.

During MSED 407-1, you chose a question that was of personal importance to you. You reviewed relevant literature related to this question, you identified different types of classroom data to investigate this question. During MSED 407-2, we will focus on techniques for analyzing the data that you have collected, revisit the literature surrounding our project, and consider how the work will influence your teaching and learning moving forward.

This course explores the theory and practice of centering discourse in approaches to learning, focusing on teaching and learning in K-12 classrooms. Work in the course will involve analyzing discourse strategies, reviewing studies of discourse in classrooms, and analyzing video of classroom interactions to see these approaches in action. We will consider examples from elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms, and across multiple disciplines including math, literacy, history, science, and others. We will examine how learners engage in and learn through discourse, and how a teacher or facilitator can support an environment in which students feel welcome and responsible for contributing by sharing their ideas, building on one another's thinking, and working together to further their learning as a community. Students will have the opportunity to apply the theories, tools, and strategies to design or analyze a discourse-rich environment for a context of their choice, or to try out these tools in facilitating discussions with their peers.

In addition to the hard work of design and proposal development, as young and developing scholars, students are challenged throughout the quarter to consider the implications of assuming the role of knowledge producer and to think through the responsibilities inherent within this work. This process is fostered through thoughtful, critical analysis of published scholarship, evaluation of the costs/benefits and quality of others' work, and careful reflection on the students' own positionalities and design choices.

In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation. The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents."]]}]},{"i":"000643","c":"SESP","t":"Race, Inequality, and the Political Analysis of Public Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"313-0","s":[{"i":"000643-20","r":[{"n":"Sally Afia Nuamah"}],"t":"Race, Inequality, and the Political Analysis of Public Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"313-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 345"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":35,"p":[["Overview of class","In this course, students learn about the centrality of race and inequality across the American political system (e.g., parties, elections, congress) and develop mechanisms for using policy processes and practices to produce positive change.

We will then consider one cause and solution of poverty for families—education—from early childhood to adulthood. Throughout the quarter, we will critically evaluate public policy and scientific research through a social justice, anti-racist lens with an eye towards a more inclusive and equitable society. This course will combine lecture and seminar format. Class discussions will complement the material presented in the lecture by encouraging you to reflect on your own experiences and providing a platform for diverse perspectives to be shared within our classroom community. These materials and discussion may help you to challenge assumptions you may unknowingly hold and gain insight on how it has shaped your perspective and behavior.

Writers will read a variety of sources on the pursuit of happiness and conduct their own research to reflect, shape, and argue their perspective.

Ethnographic understanding emerges through human exchange and collaborative meaning making, both between the anthropologist and research participants (participation) and between individuals in the field of investigation or fieldsite (observation). What does it mean, then, to do ethnography in the archives? Archives -- inscribed traces of lived worlds left by people - seeming cannot speak back to the reader. Without this lived exchange, what can we learn from documents created historically for administrative purposes of states or colonial empires? In this graduate seminar, we consider both narratives of state domination through text creation and possible stories about actions of individuals in non-dominant social groups, especially women, children, the poor, and ethnic minorities. Rather than adopting purely an anti-empirical approach to archived texts, we consider ways in which the bureaucratic scribe's record is both situated fact and angled purpose, and how documents' potential stories exceed their intended purposes. Theoretical and conceptual readings frame case studies from the MENA region including Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, and Morocco. Students write and workshop original research papers from an archival corpus of their choice."],["Class Materials (Required)","Scans and pdfs of most materials will be provided.

class","Spring Flora merges aspects of plant evolution and identification (with an emphasis on learning about the local flora) with plant ecology (with an emphasis on ecological interactions and adaptations). This course takes a field-based approach to learn the process of identifying major components of the local flora. Understanding the vegetative and reproductive structures of plants and the use of this knowledge to identify plants with taxonomic keys will be emphasized. Ecological interactions, adaptations, and related conservation issues will also be discussed. The lecture portion of the course will take place synchronously on NU campus (in Evanston) on Monday. The field component will be offered on Wednesday, outdoors on campus, at Chicago Botanic Garden (Glencoe, IL) or in nearby natural areas.

We will address questions that sit at the interface of genetics and society, such as: How do our genes really influence our health? What are the problems with the concept of genetic race, and why do scientists who study race describe race as a social construct? How do new genetic approaches help us dig deeper into our ancestries, and what are the societal and ethical implications of those approaches?

Yet, in the epoch of border walls and offshored refugee processing centers, this assumed porosity of borders begs a reexamination of broader geographies of power and tactics of movement.

How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others?

The course will consider impact of these ideologies on subject formation by reviewing their progression over time through theoretical arguments and evidence from case studies. Because race has been central to the forms of power and authority that first undergirded the colonial system and later birthed the many Latin American nations, we can trace a continued line of transmission of racialized ideologies that structure inequality in the region. Using a cultural and linguistic anthropological framework, we will approach these racial categories as composites of markers of otherness that include skin color, clothing, kin affiliations, occupation, among others. The course moves progressively from research about the early colonial period and forward chronologically until the 20th century, with a final discussion of migrant trajectories to the US. Topics covered will include variations in how race is defined and invoked in context, identity as a performative effect, coloniality as an ongoing process, and the role of historical memory in post-colonial Latin America."],["Class Materials (Required)","\"•\tGarcía, M.E.

Without this lived exchange, what can we learn from documents created historically for administrative purposes of states or colonial empires? In this graduate seminar, we consider both narratives of state domination through text creation and possible stories about actions of individuals in non-dominant social groups, especially women, children, the poor, and ethnic minorities. Rather than adopting purely an anti-empirical approach to archived texts, we consider ways in which the bureaucratic scribe's record is both situated fact and angled purpose, and how documents' potential stories exceed their intended purposes.

The ways in which artists have approached, contested, reflected, and reconfigured the problems and possibilities of institutions—be they social, governmental, academic, political, commercial, media-based, or the art world itself—is a central theme around which the course will find critical traction and build historical context. In addition to cultivating an understanding of what has made particular genres and instances of artistic practice significant to art history, this course allows us to think about how globalization, technology, current world conflicts, and social media, for example, have shaped artistic production, art criticism, and the art market. It also asks us to reflect upon the temporality of our present and what it is that is \"contemporary\" to our \"now.\" Assignments might include short writing assignments based on local art exhibitions of international artists, weekly readings and online viewings, a midterm, and a take-home final exam.

The Ottoman dynasty transformed the ancient Byzantine metropolis of Constantinople into the material embodiment of its imperial ambitions over Europe, Africa, and Asia. Yet these top-down efforts to recast Istanbul in the Ottoman image did not go unchallenged by Istanbulites themselves, who imagined alternative social orders for their city and reappropriated urban spaces as sites of public resistance.

This course seeks new avenues for addressing the role of labor (human and non-human, free and unfree) in medieval art and architectural production by bringing together archaeological research alongside medieval archival and descriptive sources. In addition to considering previous art historical attempts to engage this question, we will also look to methodologies and debates surrounding key issues such as craft specialization in archaeological literature as well as to methods such as critical fabulation that may open space for telling the stories obscured in the archive. A series of guest speakers specializing in different geographic regions of Afro-Eurasia will help us consider both the interregional nature of labor flows and the variable nature of source materials and previous research on these topics across the different subdisciplines of African, Chinese, European and Islamic art history.

But how are these Korean \"madwomen\" similar to and different from the mad women written by, for instance, Charlotte Brontë or Toni Morrison? How can we reread the tradition of feminist literary criticism that aims to derive emancipatory politics from the long social association between women with \"madness,\" a concept that carries \"seductive inexactness in its archaism\" (Megan Finch), in light of its critical revival in disability studies and mad studies? Most of all, how should we connect the literary representation of angry, violent, or depressed women whose voices are denied by the patriarchal social order with the explosive rise of the feminist movement in contemporary South Korea? With these questions in mind, this course closely reads major South Korean novels and short stories written by women writers, often juxtaposing them with the voices of ordinary Korean feminists today. In this context, another guiding question will focus on how Korean feminists develop and articulate radical politics and voices, navigating between the global rise of neoliberal feminism and the persisting patriarchal violence of capitalist society that continues to label women's voices for social justice as irrational.

The seminar asks: what happens when literary texts approach historical violence with irony and irreverence? How do we engage different scales of violence across the Pacific without reducing them to relics of the past or objects in a museum framed by somber mood? Would doing so cause offense, or reveal something unsaid about how we are often asked to engage such histories? First, you will read the Anishinaabe writer and thinker Gerald Vizenor's Hiroshima Bugi: Atomu 57 (2003), followed by the Korean American poet and non-fiction writer Cathy Park Hong's Dance Dance Revolution (2007). Weaving together stories of the atomic bombing, military occupations, settler colonialism, imperialism, and disablement, these texts serve as a gateway to explore the questions raised in transpacific studies on decolonization. While focusing on Hiroshima, Kwangju, and White Earth reservation as key sites of inquiry, the seminar will bridge relevant readings from Asian Studies, Asian American Studies, and Native American and Indigenous Studies. This seminar will be discussion-centered with several writing assignments. No prior knowledge of the geographic areas or language skills are necessary. Students with prior exposure to at least one literary, cultural studies, or theory course at 200 or 300 level (if you are unsure, email Professor We) are encouraged to enroll, though there are no pre-requisites.

The course strongly emphasizes conceptual understanding and offers extensive student-teacher interaction. Active participation in all course elements is encouraged and advantageous as students are expected to move past memorization of facts to a fully interconnected and integrated understanding that allows students to apply their knowledge to solve complex problems. This course will equip students preparing for the MCAT and upper level biochemistry courses. Quizzes (30 minutes) are held during the Wednesday 7-8:50pmpm discussion section for Biol_Sci 301. The first midterm is scheduled for Wed. April 24th from 7-9pm. The second midterm is scheduled Wed. May 22nd from 7-9pm. If another class conflicts with a Biol_Sci 301 quizzes and exams, we do not offer an alternate time. The lowest score of the six quizzes will be automatically dropped."],["Registration Requirements","Prerequisites: Students must have completed BIOL_SCI 201 and have completed or be currently enrolled in, CHEM 210-1 or CHEM 212-1 or CHEM 215-1."],["Evaluation Method","There will be 2 exams, and weekly quizzes (Wed evenings) and homework assignments (Achieve). The second midterm is not cumulative. These will test proficiency through a combination of open questions in three categories: common knowledgebase, conceptual understanding, and complex problem-solving skills. To do well on these tests, it is essential that students are able to make connections between disparate pieces knowledge/class content, and to apply knowledge to unfamiliar new contexts."],["Class Materials (Required)","There are two options for the textbook and materials.

20th century. We will read and consider fiction, poetry, non-fiction prose (slave narratives,) and speeches with the goal of developing an understanding of what the major political, social, and aesthetic concerns were for African Americans who had access to writing, and those who used the spoken word. Central to this course, and to understanding and engaging the literature will be a critical appreciation of the historical moments that surround the writing. We will look closely at how 18th- and 19th-century African American writers fashioned themselves in the world and how such fashioning reflected their conceptualization of their selfhood and identity—specifically in the ways in which they identified via race, class, and gender in antebellum society and beyond. Ultimately, by the end of the quarter, you will have a deeper understanding of how these early years of African American literary production informed and nurtured the centuries of cultural production that followed."],["Class Materials (Required)","The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color Line/ Charles W.

How did they also develop their own imagination of social justice, autonomy, and emancipation? Based on a wide range of materials and references driven from social sciences scholarship, but also from literature and cinema, the course aims to introduce undergraduate students to a non-US centered and a transnational perspective on black feminisms. The historical period covered will span from 1945-1946 to the contemporary era without intending to be exhaustive. Depending on the needs of very specific topics addressed in the class, some comparative insights with the Caribbean and/or English-speaking Africa might be included. The pedagogical and intellectual stake of the course is twofold. First, it calls students to reflect on the varying ways in which the very notion of \"blackness\" (which has no rigorous equivalent in French), and norms of gender and sexuality make sense or not in specific cultural, historical, but also religious and linguistic contexts. Second, the exploration of those different experiences and expressions of black feminisms and/or womanisms is an invitation to critically approach the concepts of \"subjugated knowledges\" and of \"black feminist epistemologies\"."]]}]},{"i":"001221","c":"WCAS","t":"Internship in African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"396-0","s":[{"i":"001221-20","t":"Internship in African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"396-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":15}]},{"i":"019283","c":"WCAS","t":"Graduate Topics in African American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"480-0","s":[{"i":"019283-20","r":[{"n":"John David Marquez","p":"847 491 5122","a":"1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-135"}],"t":"Graduate Topics in African American Studies","k":"Theorizing Blackness and Diaspora","u":"BLK_ST","n":"480-0","s":"20","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-331"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","This course aims to enhance understanding of how Blackness and Black diaspora have been theorized by scholars in Black Studies.

Morrison the author created a canon that centers on and celebrates the complexities of Black American life—particularly the lives of Black women. As a public scholar Morrison scrutinized the ways in which the American/Western literary canon often fails to acknowledge and include the important cultural contributions of African-descended literary artists. We will utilize Morrison's fiction, critical theory, lectures, and interviews to survey how she grappled with the constitution of blackness as it relates to the modern conception of humanity.

This triple gesture - linguistic, political and cultural - calls for taking seriously the original formation and expressions of Black feminisms in diasporic and global contexts. It also implies using an intersectional approach to analyze the enduring consequences of colonialism of former European empires on the very soil of their metropoles. The course will therefore pay particular attention to the historical and social conditions of the emergence of black feminist struggles against patriarchy, racist minoritization and social inequality in a social and political context of white hegemony, where systemic racism is generally considered as \"a notion imported from the United States\". The reflections and readings will more specifically focus on France, a country which is paradigmatic of institutionalized race denial in Europe. Formerly a slave-owning colonial empire which has been marked by massive immigration of workers from Africa, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean from the 1960s to the 1990s, France still maintains ambiguous political and economic ties with these territories, while it actively excludes any reference to race from its official legislation and has made colorblindness the bedrock of its national republican ideology. How do Afrofeminists in France, daughters of parents from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, Madagascar, Martinique or Guyana, challenge a national \"racism without race\"? To what extent are they crucially redefining the horizons of feminism, antiracism, emancipation and social justice in a context of structural denial? More broadly, what are the possible links between US Black Feminism, African Feminisms, Diasporic Feminisms, Pan-Africanism and Afrofeminism? To better understand the forms and significance of Afrofeminism in a postcolonial and global context, the French case will be contrasted with the situation of other Afrofeminists in Europe (Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany notably). To a wide extent, materials and data will be drawn from history, sociology, political theory (feminist studies and black feminist theory), but also literature and film."]]}]},{"i":"017544","c":"WCAS","t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":[{"i":"017544-20","r":[{"n":"Oladotun Babatope Ayobade"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-21","r":[{"n":"Marquis Bey West"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"21","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-22","r":[{"n":"Herman Barnor Hesse","p":"8474913775","a":"1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-131"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"22","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-23","r":[{"n":"Elondust Johnson"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"23","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-24","r":[{"n":"John David Marquez","p":"847 491 5122","a":"1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-135"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"24","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-25","r":[{"n":"Mary E Pattillo","p":"847/491-3409","a":"1860 Campus Dr. Crowe 5-111","o":"TBA"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"25","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-26","r":[{"n":"Kennetta Hammond Perry"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"26","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-27","r":[{"n":"Kihana Miraya Ross"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"27","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-28","r":[{"n":"Nitasha Tamar Sharma","p":"847/467-6589","a":"Crowe Hall 1-127","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"28","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-29","r":[{"n":"Tracy L Vaughn","p":"8474913725","a":"1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-103"}],"t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"29","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-30","t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"30","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-31","t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"31","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"017544-32","t":"Independent Study","u":"BLK_ST","n":"490-0","s":"32","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10}]},{"i":"018031","c":"WCAS","t":"Reading and Pedagogy","u":"BLK_ST","n":"491-0","s":[{"i":"018031-20","t":"Reading and Pedagogy","u":"BLK_ST","n":"491-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":10},{"i":"018031-21","t":"Reading and Pedagogy","u":"BLK_ST","n":"491-0","s":"21","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":10},{"i":"018031-22","t":"Reading and Pedagogy","u":"BLK_ST","n":"491-0","s":"22","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":10}]},{"i":"001649","c":"WCAS","t":"Accounting","u":"BUS_INST","n":"301-0","s":[{"i":"001649-20","r":[{"n":"Robin J Bakal","a":"r-soffer@northwestern.edu","b":"Robin Soffer teaches Accounting in the Business Institutions program.

As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors. The full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of: Instrumental analysis; Synthesis of inorganic compounds; Synthesis of organic compounds; Spectroscopy. The course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example: In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses. CHEMISTRY 350-3: The 3rd course in this sequence covers the very important topic of spectroscopy from a physical chemistry point of view. It deals with the use of various spectroscopic techniques (FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, uv/visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) for structure determination of gas and liquid phase molecules and for kinetics measurements.

We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clanged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of main Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine.

In this work, he famously called for a more nuanced and perhaps more difficult project of decolonization after pollical independence from colonialism. Language, he observed, must be an essential feature of every long lasting decolonial project. Subsequently, he changed his own creative language from English to Gikuyu. Ngũgĩ's book has resonated with the thorny entanglement of language and the colonial legecy across the African continent and beyond since at least the mid-20th century. For instance, in 1962 Malek Haddad famously abandoned creative writing all together following Algeria's independence since he could not write in Arabic and refused to continue in French. In Senegal, Boubacar Boris Diop shifted two decades ago his primary language of creative writing to Wolof and has undertaken self-translation. In 2013, the Moroccan Abdelfattah Kilito published Je parle toutes les langues mais en Arabe, a title inspired by Kafka, foregrounding the irony subtending the decolonial/postcolonial context to date since the book is written in French. This course is dedicated to understanding the ways in which this multifaceted problematic has been thought both theoretically and creatively by thinkers hailing from Francophone Africa, in conversation with theorists of language and translation from beyond the continent. The aim of the course is neither to be exhaustive nor to limit the scope of our investigations regionally or linguistically. Students will be invited to reflect with nuance on the questions in context and develop their own projects by bearing in mind both the universality of the question and the singularity of its inscription.

If for Foucault the possibility of an affirmative biopolitics still exists, such a prospect is no longer true for Agamben and Mbembe. To understand the implications of this shift, we will focus first on Agamben's Homo Sacer and its reinterpretation of biopolitics as thanatopolitics, paying attention to the text's epistemic and geopolitical limits and its ongoing relevance for refugee studies. We will then explore Mbembe's post-colonial redefinition of biopolitics as necropolitics, or the racist subjugation of life to the power of death of unwanted population. What is the relationship between sovereignty and biopolitics? Is racism an effect of biopolitics or its premise? In order to confront these questions, we will reflect on a specific constellation of notions in our contemporary philosophical lexicon that have originated in these and other key texts: state of exception, the ban, homo sacer, bare life, the living dead, death worlds, enmity, abandonment, wars, borders, and brutalism. In addition, we will assess the meaning of the different paradigmatic sites of the modern politicization of life: the camp for Agamben and the plantation, the colonies, and the occupied territories for Mbembe. In the last phase of the course, we will read recent essays by Mbembe in which he tries to conceive forms of resistance to necropolitics. We will pay special attention to Mbembe's concepts of restitution, reparation, and care. Seminar participants are strongly encouraged to find a way to use Foucault, Agamben, and/or Mbembe's work in their own research projects.

This course provides an interdisciplinary treatment of the science of deformation of solid Earth with an emphasis on the materials science (microscopic) approach. We cover mechanical behavior over various time-scales, including the elastic, anelastic (viscoelastic), and plastic response, in addition to the applications of these results to important geological and geophysical problems. Special attention is given to high-temperature creep of olivine, the main constituent of the lithosphere and upper mantle. No previous knowledge of geology/geophysics or of materials science is assumed. The basics of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics are presented as far as they are relevant to the main topics of the course."],["Class Materials (Required)","Ranalli, G. (1995).

Just kidding, it's fine! On the eve of Jan 1st, 2000, some theorized that in all our busy progress, we hadn't accounted for an inevitable technological apocalypse that would occur when the clock struck midnight. But it never happened. This phenomenon reflected the anxieties that some felt as they entered what they considered to be a new era of humankind. In this course, we'll think about how these kinds of anxieties plague a culture as its members reflect on the century passed and look forward to another. We'll think about how literature reflects a kind of mixed bag of emotions at those times society decides that we are ready to enter a new era: anxiety, dread, trepidation, but also nostalgia. We will encounter texts published in the late 1800s and early 1900s, such as the stories of Edith Wharton and James Joyce, alongside films produced in the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as Moulin Rouge! and Girl, Interrupted. How does forward-looking progress affect the way individuals see themselves and their places in the world? How can we productively reflect on the past and the future? As we consider these narratives about ‘progress,' we might think about our own identities as students, writers, and subjects in our contemporary world. Because this is a writing-focused course, we will work through these questions through reflective written assignments that analyze why authors choose to write in particular ways, reviews of films and books, argumentative papers, and a longer research paper.

How do writers as different as Homer and Octavia Bulter meditate on the experience of displacement as well as possibilities for new kinds of citizenship? Our goal in this class will be to see how literature can offer different theories of what home and humanity can mean. Beginning with the classical epic hero Odysseus who desperately battles monsters, seductive women, and vengeful gods to get home from the Trojan war, we turn to more modern stories where travelers are not traditional heroes but figures who feel vulnerable or alienated even within their home spaces. Even as their journeys share themes of violence and renewal—and fantasy and realism—these different works steer us to contemplate strikingly different problems such as immigration, racial inequities, and climate change. Texts will likely include Margaret Atwood's feminist recentering of The Odyssey in the domestic space (The Penelopiad); Shakespeare's tragic story of lovers' journeying to war on a Mediterranean island where danger resides where they least expect it (Othello); Octavia Butler's apocalyptic cli-fi story about a young Black woman's attempt to refound a world utterly destroyed (The Parable of the Sower); Maurice Sendak's children's book about punishment, nourishment, and fantasy (Where the Wild Things Are); creative nonfictional narratives of detainees in the UK (Refugee Tales); Mohsin Hamid's poignant tale of Middle Eastern exiled lovers who find a magic portal to lands where outcasts band together for survival (Exit West); and Yuri Herrera's stunning rewriting of Odysseus as a young Mexican woman undertaking a hazardous borderland crossing to the US to reconnect her family (Signs Preceding the End of the World).

The four groundbreaking novels we'll read span 200 years and multiple continents, and explore a striving for belonging that is complicated by issues of ethnic, racial and sexual identity.

We will think about Shakespeare's contexts and how they matter: a theatre on the outskirts of ever-expanding Renaissance London; a financially successful acting company in which he played the simultaneous and often overlapping roles of writer, actor, and co-owner; a world of reading and writing in which words, plots, and texts were constantly being re-circulated into new plays; the rich possibilities of the English language around 1600. We will centrally consider the ways in which these theatrical, literary, and cultural questions register within the plays themselves. What do words, plays, stories do—how do they work—in Shakespeare's plays? Who or what is an audience or an actor in these plays? How do Shakespeare's plays stage issues such as gender, race, religion, sexuality, social class, entertainment and the media -- and how does his approach to these issues continue to speak to our own era?"],["Teaching Method","Lectures with discussion; required weekly discussion section."],["Evaluation Method","Papers, midterm, final, discussion participation."],["Class Materials (Required)","We'll use the high-quality, inexpensive Folger Library annotated paperback editions of the following plays, ed.

All assignments will be geared toward building the specific skills needed to undertake research in the humanities and to become a knowledge maker, with attention to designing a viable research project, identifying and treating historical and interpretative sources responsibly, and developing a sustained argument with strong evidence. Students may choose to investigate any afterlife of any Shakespearean play in their final research project; this afterlife might take the form of play, YA book, graphic novel, translation, ballet, puppet performance, film, or literary adaptation."],["Class Materials (Required)","Aimé Césaire's A Tempest (trans.

This development has generated both cultural and aesthetic questions—and a fair amount of skepticism—about the nature of first books and their inception. Surveying a sample of recent first books, in 2015, William Doreski, for example, argued that the first book (and indeed the poetry) of our era too often depends on \"an autobiographical mode that has evolved from what was once called confessional poetry…[and] underscores a particular social allegiance,\" wherein \"identity is the issue,\" rather than poetic experimentation and imaginative discovery. In this hybrid literature-creative writing course, we will study four first books by contemporary poets, exploring the ways in which these collections have announced themselves as \"first books\" and/or resisted the above cultural expectations of first books. Together we will consider these questions: What is the \"concept\" of the book (e.g., is it a \"project\" book or an arrangement of discrete poems?)? Which formal and aesthetic strategies are deployed in it, both at the poem-level and across the collection? To what end? And how might you bring those conceptual, aesthetic and formal strategies to your own first-book projects? Deep and engaged close reading will be at the center of our discussions. In all cases, the poets will have gone on to publish at least a second book. In alternate weeks, students will present an excerpt of the poet's second (or later) book to the class, focusing on the ways in which that book serves as a departure from and/or an extension of the first. After each presentation, we will have a class visit from the poet. Weekly assignments will include critical responses to each of the books, including close-readings of individual poems, presentations, and the drafting of original poetry (or in another genre), using the tools provided by the collections we read. The final project will consist of original creative work, accompanied by a critical statement about your book project, informed by your study of the four first books we will read together."],["Teaching Method","A mixture of discussion of assigned reading and presentations."],["Evaluation Method","Written critical responses to readings/poem assignments - 20% Ability to Critique/Class Participation - 20% Presentations - 20% Final Portfolio: Poems (15 pages), critical statement (5-7 pages) - 40% (Poems/creative work - 20%) (Critical essay to accompany creative work - 20%)"],["Class Materials (Required)","Catherine Barnett, Into Perfect Spheres Such Holes Are Pierced; Chen Chen, When I Grow Up, I Want to Be a List of Further Possibilities; Eduardo Corral, Slow Lightning; Robin Coste Lewis, Voyage of the Sable Venus; Richard Siken, Crush"],["Class Notes","Note: While this course is designed for poets, organized around first books of poetry, creative writers of other genres are welcome to attend.

While social contract theory would soon reach new predominance (ie with Thomas Hobbes in the 17thC and rising 18thC claims about the foundational role of consent to government), what models preceded it? What claims and values justified the apparent organicism of a faith or reliance on the human body as an allegory for political authority? How do these approaches manage qualities like gender, age, or illness that might trouble the allegory? This seminar will consider some key texts in early English political thought, beginning with the Tudor court case from which the phrase \"the body politic\" is mainly cited, and proceeding then to materials from the unsettling events of the English Reformation that address the question of obedience to the secular power (ie Thomas More's Utopia, William Tyndale's Obedience of a Christian Man, Thomas Cranmer's homilies from the first decade of the English church) and to anatomical and medical materials (like Thomas Elyot's Castel of Helthe and Helkiah Crooke's Microcosmographia). From this groundwork, we will move on consider early modern English debates about royal authority, including the ideological disarray triggered by the historical facts of a female monarch and of rebellion as treason (ie John Knox's First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, selected speeches given by Elizabeth I, James I's The Law of Free Monarchy, and John Milton's Tenure of Kings and Magistrates). To explore these dynamics in the context of theater (then the largest assemblages of people into \"bodies\"), the seminar will delve into several Shakespeare plays (from among Henry IV 1&2, Richard II, Richard III, A Midsummer Night's Dream, King Lear, and most particularly Measure for Measure) to assess the proposition that Shakespeare — among his other forms of attention — was also a political theorist."]]}]},{"i":"001871","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in Contemporary Literature","u":"ENGLISH","n":"461-0","s":[{"i":"001871-20","r":[{"n":"Evan M Mwangi"}],"t":"Studies in Contemporary Literature","k":"Ecologies of the Global South","u":"ENGLISH","n":"461-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":12,"p":[["Overview of class","This course examines the interface of ecology and literary form in literatures of the global south within the larger contexts of post-1945 global literary production.

The class will also discuss the perils and thrills of studying texts and themes that might be considered too contemporary and non-canonical. What are the best methodologies of studying and teaching these texts, most of which are comparatively not well known? We will study and comment on the various techniques individual contemporary texts (or sets of such texts) use to represent contemporary ethical and political concerns, including their allusion to older texts. We will also discuss the invocation of ecological metaphors in the various texts of postcolonial theory (e.g., the comparison of the preservation of indigenous languages and cultures with conservation of biodiversity). The course's primary premise is that formalist analysis of texts (ala Robert Langhaum) is where all good criticism begins, not where it ends.

The following questions will guide the class:\n• What environmental problems arose in South Asia through accelerated economic development across the 20th century and early 21st century?\n• Who suffered the most, why, and how were they affected, socially, culturally, and materially?\n• What strategies for justice and sustainability emerged?\n• How is environmental justice understood across activists, policymakers, and ordinary people whose lives are most in danger?"]],"f":"3"},{"i":"018572-26","r":[{"n":"Douglas Metoxen Kiel","p":"847/467-4821","a":"Harris 229"}],"t":"Special Topics in Environmental Policy and Culture","k":"Red Power: Indigenous Resistance in the US and Can","u":"ENVR_POL","n":"390-0","s":"26","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall 107"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":90,"p":[["Overview of class","In 2016, thousands of Indigenous water protectors and their non-Native allies camped at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in an effort to block the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In this work, he famously called for a more nuanced and perhaps more difficult project of decolonization after pollical independence from colonialism. Language, he observed, must be an essential feature of every long lasting decolonial project. Subsequently, he changed his own creative language from English to Gikuyu. Ngũgĩ's book has resonated with the thorny entanglement of language and the colonial legecy across the African continent and beyond since at least the mid-20th century. For instance, in 1962 Malek Haddad famously abandoned creative writing all together following Algeria's independence since he could not write in Arabic and refused to continue in French. In Senegal, Boubacar Boris Diop shifted two decades ago his primary language of creative writing to Wolof and has undertaken self-translation. In 2013, the Moroccan Abdelfattah Kilito published Je parle toutes les langues mais en Arabe, a title inspired by Kafka, foregrounding the irony subtending the decolonial/postcolonial context to date since the book is written in French. This course is dedicated to understanding the ways in which this multifaceted problematic has been thought both theoretically and creatively by thinkers hailing from Francophone Africa, in conversation with theorists of language and translation from beyond the continent. The aim of the course is neither to be exhaustive nor to limit the scope of our investigations regionally or linguistically. Students will be invited to reflect with nuance on the questions in context and develop their own projects by bearing in mind both the universality of the question and the singularity of its inscription.

French-language authors have produced some of the most radical critiques of French and European imperial projects in the modern era while innovating within related fields such as critical race studies, gender and sexuality studies, discourse analysis, literary theory, and philosophy. Yet, their reception in the Anglophone academy has often been marked by decontextualized or selective readings. Our priority will be to foreground the specificity of the French-language decolonial tradition as a response to a particular brand of colonialism rooted in a universalizing, humanist project, as well as to particular local manifestations and effects of this project. Ranging across four main sites of theoretical production, including revolutionary Haiti, the mid-20th-century French Caribbean, Paris, and Sub-Saharan Africa, our readings will highlight the ways in which French-language thinkers from Jean-Jacques Dessalines to Achille Mbembe have forged a distinctly non-essentialist theoretical tradition by working within and against intellectual currents of Enlightenment universalism, existentialism, historical materialism, psychoanalysis, structuralism, and post-structuralism. At the same time, through critical analysis and secondary readings, we will evaluate the continued relevance of these thinkers' attempts to conceptualize problems of intellectual and psychic (dis)alienation, postcolonial sovereignty, cultural hybridity, emancipatory artistic creation, and freedom for intellectual projects in the humanities and social sciences today.

If for Foucault the possibility of an affirmative biopolitics still exists, such a prospect is no longer true for Agamben and Mbembe. To understand the implications of this shift, we will focus first on Agamben's Homo Sacer and its reinterpretation of biopolitics as thanatopolitics, paying attention to the text's epistemic and geopolitical limits and its ongoing relevance for refugee studies. We will then explore Mbembe's post-colonial redefinition of biopolitics as necropolitics, or the racist subjugation of life to the power of death of unwanted population. What is the relationship between sovereignty and biopolitics? Is racism an effect of biopolitics or its premise? In order to confront these questions, we will reflect on a specific constellation of notions in our contemporary philosophical lexicon that have originated in these and other key texts: state of exception, the ban, homo sacer, bare life, the living dead, death worlds, enmity, abandonment, wars, borders, and brutalism. In addition, we will assess the meaning of the different paradigmatic sites of the modern politicization of life: the camp for Agamben and the plantation, the colonies, and the occupied territories for Mbembe. In the last phase of the course, we will read recent essays by Mbembe in which he tries to conceive forms of resistance to necropolitics.

Much of that reckoning is about the colonial origins and underpinnings of the field, with a particular focus on \"unfair knowledge practices\" or epistemic injustice. In this seminar, we will examine the landscape of unfair knowledge practices in global health - i.e., the pervasive wrongs related to knowledge making, knowledge use, and knowledge sharing in global health - many of which are taken for granted. We will start with the unfairness inherent in how we often define global health itself, and what decolonisation means in relation to \"global health\". Using a range of conceptual tools, we will then examine various common practices especially in academic global health (e.g., authorship practices, research partnerships, academic writing, editorial practices, sensemaking/interpretive practices, and the choice of research audience, framing, topics, questions, and methods) and discuss when, how, and under what circumstances they may be deemed fair or unfair. We will use practical examples of each category of knowledge practice to think critically about what makes them fair or unfair. Using these examples, we will also examine what strategies might be required to promote fairness or epistemic justice, including the potential roles and responsibilities of the broad range of individual and institutional actors within the knowledge ecosystem of \"global health\"."],["Class Materials (Required)","All required materials will be available on Canvas."]]}]},{"i":"023248","c":"WCAS","t":"Arch Scholar Mentoring Program","u":"GEN_LA","n":"150-0","s":[{"i":"023248-1","r":[{"n":"Lane Fenrich","p":"8474917560","a":"1922 Sheridan Rd."},{"n":"Aseel Abulhab"},{"n":"Lauren Elizabeth Ingram Cole"}],"t":"Arch Scholar Mentoring Program","u":"GEN_LA","n":"150-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":60}]},{"i":"021468","c":"WCAS","t":"UPAL: Strategies for Advancing Learning","u":"GEN_LA","n":"160-0","s":[{"i":"021468-01","r":[{"n":"Shawn William Bush"}],"t":"UPAL: Strategies for Advancing Learning","u":"GEN_LA","n":"160-0","s":"01","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":0}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G32"],"d":"2024-04-08","e":"2024-05-26","c":"TUT","a":8},{"i":"021468-02","r":[{"n":"Shawn William Bush"}],"t":"UPAL: Strategies for Advancing Learning","u":"GEN_LA","n":"160-0","s":"02","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":17,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G31"],"d":"2024-04-08","e":"2024-05-26","c":"TUT"},{"i":"021468-03","r":[{"n":"Shawn William Bush"}],"t":"UPAL: Strategies for Advancing Learning","u":"GEN_LA","n":"160-0","s":"03","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":0}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G31"],"d":"2024-04-08","e":"2024-05-26","c":"TUT","a":8},{"i":"021468-04","r":[{"n":"Shawn William Bush"}],"t":"UPAL: Strategies for Advancing Learning","u":"GEN_LA","n":"160-0","s":"04","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":0}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G31"],"d":"2024-04-08","e":"2024-05-26","c":"TUT","a":8},{"i":"021468-05","r":[{"n":"Shawn William Bush"}],"t":"UPAL: Strategies for Advancing Learning","u":"GEN_LA","n":"160-0","s":"05","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":0}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G31"],"d":"2024-04-08","e":"2024-05-26","c":"TUT","a":8}]},{"i":"019135","c":"WCAS","t":"Residence-Linked Seminar - VI (Literature and Fine Arts)","u":"GEN_LA","n":"280-6","s":[{"i":"019135-20","t":"Residence-Linked Seminar - VI (Literature and Fine Arts)","k":"From Hamilton to 'Hamilton': Race, Gender, and Gen","u":"GEN_LA","n":"280-6","s":"20","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":10,"o":"6"},{"i":"019135-21","t":"Residence-Linked Seminar - VI (Literature and Fine Arts)","k":"Movies as Mentors: A Guiding Light into Latino Am","u":"GEN_LA","n":"280-6","s":"21","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":10,"o":"6"}]},{"i":"001041","c":"WCAS","t":"Residence-Linked Seminar","u":"GEN_LA","n":"280-7","s":[{"i":"001041-21","t":"Residence-Linked Seminar","k":"Leading and Managing Organizations","u":"GEN_LA","n":"280-7","s":"21","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":10}]},{"i":"016853","c":"WCAS","t":"Undergraduate Research","u":"GEN_LA","n":"290-0","s":[{"i":"016853-20","t":"Undergraduate Research","k":"Winter","u":"GEN_LA","n":"290-0","s":"20","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":32}]},{"i":"001882","c":"WCAS","t":"North America","u":"GEOG","n":"313-0","s":[{"i":"001882-20","r":[{"n":"John Crandall Hudson","p":"847/491-2855","a":"Locy Hall #104"}],"t":"North America","u":"GEOG","n":"313-0","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["555 Clark B01"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":60,"p":[["Overview of class","This course covers the geography of the United States and Canada, beginning with Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada in the first week and finishing with the Pacific Coast and Hawaii in the ninth week.

We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as a degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clinged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of major Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust.

Some participants formed research collectives and published D-I-Y guides to medical knowledge such as the Boston Women's Health Collective's \"Women and Their Bodies\" or Carol Downer's \"A New View of a Woman's Body.\" Some movement members established battered women's shelters, underground abortion referral services, and feminist health clinics. Others formed local committees and national networks, such as the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA) and the National Women's Health Network (NWHN), with the goal of transforming contemporary medical protocols and scientific research agendas. Because many of these local and national groups are still in existence, original movement goals continue to define the parameters of a \"women's health\" agenda in the present moment. On the other hand, the Women's Health Movement was (and is) a heterogeneous movement. Then, as now, groups with competing ideas about the healthcare needs of women as a group identified as part of same movement. Thus, an examination of historical and current debates over \"women's health\" is also a means of assessing several distinct, often competing, paradigms of health and disease. Moreover, how we articulate a \"women's health agenda\" depends on our (often taken-for-granted) ideas about gender, sexuality, and embodiment itself."]]}]},{"i":"025101","c":"WCAS","t":"Beyond Porn: Sexuality, Health and Pleasure","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"221-0","s":[{"i":"025101-1","r":[{"n":"Noelle Sullivan","p":"847/467-2780","a":"1800 Sherman Ave, Suite 1-200, #1-102, Evanston"}],"t":"Beyond Porn: Sexuality, Health and Pleasure","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"221-0","s":"1","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Fisk Hall 217"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":10,"p":[["Overview of class","Threesomes.

Many people look to pornography not just for entertainment, but also for education about what satisfying sexual encounters look like. Unfortunately, much of what people learn from pornography doesn't lead them to healthy and satisfying sexual encounters and relationships. This lecture class isn't actually about pornography. It goes beyond many presumptions about sex and pleasure depicted in pornography and popular culture, in order to equip students with information that can lead to more satisfying and healthy sexual experiences across their lifespan, regardless of how they identify, or who or what they like. The course also familiarizes students with a wide spectrum of human identities, practices, and attitudes towards sex and sexuality. Topics covered include: physiological and biological sex; gender; sexual orientation; homophobia and heterosexism; navigating sexual risks in a sex-positive way; sexual health disparities; sexual desire, arousal, and response; solitary sex & sex with others; sex toys; unconventional sexual practices; intimacy and effective communication; sexuality & aging; sexuality, disability & intimacy; sexual problems and solutions; sexual pleasure as part of sexual health; sexual harassment and violence; selling sex; and yes, a brief unit on problematics and possibilities in pornography.

What does fascism mean? What is socialism? Is capitalism inherently democratic? Through the lens of gender and sexuality studies, these regimes take on an extraordinary clarity, differentiating along distinct family and gender ideals, sexual freedom, reproductive rights, and personal expressions. Most importantly, these rival regimes developed dynamically in relation to each other and as responses to the crisis of total war. During World War One, military strategy and technology blurred the boundaries between war zones and home fronts. Not only did civilian populations become military targets, but the strains of war also exposed them to food shortages, fuel rationing, forced evacuations, and violent death. At the same time, disillusioned soldiers and veterans saw their war experiences through the threat of gender inversions. During the war, women had been mobilized to do men=s work. In the 1920s and >30s, the \"new woman\" of the century B building on the beginnings of legal equality and the vote B enjoyed greater economic, political, intellectual, and sexual freedoms than their nineteenth century grandmothers and great-grandmothers. If conventional warfare was defined by (and reinforced) traditional notions of heterosexuality, did the disruption of those norms mean emancipation for women? Did wars invite utopian hopes for alternate gender and sexual alignments and identities? Through novels, memoirs, primary documents, films, and propaganda art, we study the individual and collective biographies of people who struggled and thrived through these changes.

But is girlhood really so monolithic as TikTok makes it out to be? Where does girlhood get messy or monstrous, gross or gay? Who gets to be a girl, and whose bodies are forgotten in our popular narratives about girlhood? In this course, we will explore queer representations of girlhood in 20th and 21st century Anglo-American literature, cinema, and television. Our readings will ask us to consider girlhood as a contradictory set of experiences that can happen to people of all genders. We will ask what girlhood feels like to children who are all too often excluded from or only partially imagined within it, as well as for children who desire a girlhood that rejects them or reject the girlhood that is thrust upon them. To structure our questions, we will devote significant time to analyzing Kathryn Bond Stockton's \"The Queer Child, or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century\" (2009). We'll learn what it means to understand, stretch, and interrogate a major piece of queer theory through literature and art. Finally, we'll think about a cast of characters that emerge—to various degrees—in our renditions of the many places where queerness meets girlhood, including but not limited to the kid killer, the lesbian child, the tomboy, the femboy, the black femme, and the toxic (and maybe homoerotic) best friend.

A divided Europe grew increasingly connected to the rest of the world as commercial goods, people, ideas, and diseases traveled across land and sea.

This class invites students in the sciences and the humanities to explore the dynamic relationship between science, medicine, and our broader society. One theme is the relationship between the natural sciences and our material world. How has scientific knowledge led to radical new technologies like global telecommunications and the atom bomb, and how has technological change shaped theories of the natural world, from thermodynamics to climate change? Another is the relationship between the bio-medical sciences and social values. From Darwin to genomics, biological knowledge has developed in conjunction with public mores, altering our approach to health, our understanding of race and sexual difference, and our hopes for the human species.

Beyond their military prowess, however, they also functioned as cultural agents. Sedentary people - Chinese, European, Muslim or others - portrayed them as violent intruders negatively impacting their cultures; yet nomads also facilitated and directed the exchange of goods, people, animals, religions, ideas, and technologies across civilizational boundaries, and maintained a relationship of interdependence with their settled neighbors.

Not only did civilian populations become military targets, but the strains of war also exposed them to food shortages, fuel rationing, forced evacuations, and violent death. At the same time, disillusioned soldiers and veterans saw their war experiences through the threat of gender inversions. During the war, women had been mobilized to do men=s work. In the 1920s and >30s, the \"new woman\" of the century B building on the beginnings of legal equality and the vote B enjoyed greater economic, political, intellectual, and sexual freedoms than their nineteenth century grandmothers and great-grandmothers. If conventional warfare was defined by (and reinforced) traditional notions of heterosexuality, did the disruption of those norms mean emancipation for women? Did wars invite utopian hopes for alternate gender and sexual alignments and identities? Through novels, memoirs, primary documents, films, and propaganda art, we study the individual and collective biographies of people who struggled and thrived through these changes. Despite the much-touted return to happy domesticity after the half century of total war and revolutions, could the genie of sexual malcontent be ever fully re-contained?"],["Learning Objectives","This class fulfills the Historical Studies Foundational Discipline and Global Perspective Overlay on power, justice, and equity. For the Global Perspective overlay, students will learn: 1.\tHow and why gender identities and sexual norms changed during the upheavals of war and regime change over the course of the 20th century in Europe, the Russian subcontinent, and the United States. 2.\tHow the toppling European imperial hegemony in World War One created three competing systems: Socialism, Fascism, and Consumer Capitalism, locked in international competitions that sparked further warfare and conquest. 3.\tHow each of these ideological systems articulated their social ideals through new gender, sexual, racial, class, and family norms. 4.\tHow governments enforced these ideals through legal codes, policing, and social and cultural institutions. 5.\tAbout the lives of ordinary people caught up in these turmoils: why some thrived as privileged citizens while others perished or barely survived under banishment.

Courts throughout the continent tried and punished hundreds of thousands for having worked with and for Germany and the Axis powers. By and large, however, those trials concentrated on crimes of political collaboration and paid little attention to what is now accepted as the Nazis' greatest crime: the genocide of European Jewry. Although courts did punish some architects of the so-called Final Solution, thousands of Europeans who had organized, perpetrated or otherwise contributed to the Holocaust escaped with minimal penalties or no punishment at all. Over the subsequent decades individuals, organizations, and states have sought to redress the failure to seek out and punish those perpetrators at war's end. Lawyers have prosecuted and defended accused war criminals before courts. Historians have documented the development and execution of genocide, while others have sought to deny the very murders themselves. Through the examination of a series of trials, the first half of the course will discuss both the struggle to bring perpetrators to justice and the efforts to obscure the crimes that had been committed. We will consider the prosecution of war crimes and genocide in the context of the development of international law and historical knowledge over the decades from the Second World War to the present day.

Yet the purpose of the autobiography is to tell a story, not history. The autobiography is a quintessential narrative that combines history and memory, authentic details and borrowed narratives, documentary precision and artistic ambition. Autobiography is a historical narrative bordering on the literary. If so, is it possible to use autobiography in historical research? This course opens up a variety of ways to identify and neutralize the literary layer in autobiography to make it a usable historical source. This course takes the participants through five hundred years of Jewish ego-narratives including the autobiographies of rabbis and mystics, schismatics and philosophers, merchants and writers, dissidents and historians, nationalist politicians, cultural assimilationists, and even converts."],["Learning Objectives","1.

The belief that oral history interviews are the primary way to overcome archival erasure has shaped feminist, radical and LGBT history projects. However, the advent of queer theory has called some of these assumptions into question. How far does oral history privilege the voices of those who are \"out\", visible and confident? How is the relationship between interviewer and interviewee altered when both parties are LGBTQ (or assumed to be)? Finally, how can historians build a complex picture of the past when we are reliant on those who are willing to speak?

Our examples will be world-wide, ranging from the Trobriand Islands and early modern Europe to modern America, Asia, and Africa, right up to present-day debates over AI. We will consider the many people involved in the design, production, and use of objects: artisans, engineers, capitalists, laborers, enslaved peoples, children, Luddites, Futurists, and consumers of all stripes, as well as coders, hackers and hobbyists. We will consider the life cycle of banal objects, as well as liminal objects which mediate diverse realms of experience. These perspectives will be examined in light of contending theories of material change: commodity fetishism, the social construction of technology, the anthropology of the gift, gender analysis, evolutionary theory, systems theory, infrastructure studies, and performance studies.

Our theme this year is \"Water, Waterways, and Fluid Ecologies.\" Water has been a central preoccupation of environmental history/humanities/studies since their formal constitution as academic fields, not to mention a core concern of human societies for as long as humans have been around and an increasingly critical one in the age of anthropogenic global warming. Rather than focusing on global processes and flows, however, we will delve deeply into place-based histories of water from around the world. Readings will span Latin America, Europe, Africa, North America, Asia, and Pacifica and may include: Bathsheba Demuth, Floating Coast (2019); Lucas Bessire, Running Out (2021); David Aiona Chang, The World and All the Things Upon It (2016); Claudia Leal, Landscapes of Freedom (2018); Keith Dawson, Undercurrents of Power (2018); Sugata Ray, Water Histories of South Asia (2020); Vera Candiani, Dreaming of Dry Land (2014); Chandra Mukerji, Impossible Engineering (2009); Ling Zhang, The River, the Plain, and the State (2016); Philipp Lehmann, Desert Edens (2022); Richard White, The Organic Machine (1995). This course is open to graduate students in all fields of history and from all disciplinary backgrounds, including the natural and social sciences, who have an interest in water and the environment."],["Learning Objectives","To become familiar with the scope and methods of environmental history, as a disciplinary practice and in relation to interdisciplinary fields like the environmental humanities.

The depth and intricacy of Caribbean history, and its centrality to world history is one of the reasons for this fascination. Slavery and emancipation; colonialism and imperialism; republicanism and revolution; nationalism and decolonization, are some of the historical categories of analysis that from a Greater Caribbean perspective complicate easy periodizations, clear-cut imperial boundaries, and ready-made gender and racial constructs. This course introduces graduate students to this historical/historiographical complexity, and the generations of scholars who have contributed to Caribbean studies with a profusion of theoretical and interpretative lenses. We will start with the cornerstone of the scholarship: What is the Caribbean? Then, we will consider specific topics, and the variety of approaches in their study in order to examine multiple frames and bridge the different linguistic, and imperial areas."],["Learning Objectives","The goal is dual. On the one hand, from a humanistic point of view, we will seek to comprehend what roles people living in this region played in some of the major historical transformations of the last four centuries; and how the interconnected processes of Caribbean economic and sociopolitical development shaped and impact the formation of a capitalist world system. On the other hand, from an academic perspective, we will draw connections among different fields, i.e. African Diaspora, Latin America, Atlantic, and Global History; and begin to master the classic books and most influential recent works published in English (or translated) on Caribbean history."],["Evaluation Method","Discussions, oral presentations, papers."],["Class Materials (Required)","Some materials will be available through Canvas, others will be under reserve at the library, and other will be available for purchase at the bookstore"],["Class Notes","Concentration: Americas"]]},{"i":"002203-26","r":[{"n":"Robert A Orsi","p":"847 4675175","a":"Crowe Hall, 1860 Campus Drive, 4-141","o":"TBA"},{"n":"Christine M Helmer","p":"847/491-2616","a":"Kresge Hall #3341","o":"Wed 2-4 pm on zoom"}],"t":"Topics in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"492-0","s":"26","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":30}],"l":["Crowe 4-130 Rel Studies Sem Rm"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":15}]},{"i":"002206","c":"WCAS","t":"Research Seminar in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"570-2","s":[{"i":"002206-20","r":[{"n":"Kathleen C Belew","p":"847/467-2305","a":"Harris Hall 242"}],"t":"Research Seminar in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"570-2","s":"20","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall 108"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":15}]},{"i":"002208","c":"WCAS","t":"Directed Research in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"580-2","s":[{"i":"002208-01","r":[{"n":"Kenneth L Alder","p":"847/467-4038","a":"Harris Hall 307"}],"t":"Directed Research in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"580-2","s":"01","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"002208-02","r":[{"n":"Michael J.

This course offers conceptual tools and perspectives for answering these controversies. To do so it surveys a variety of topics related to the intersections of health, biomedicine, culture, and society. We will analyze the cultural meanings associated with health and illness; the political debates surrounding health care, medical knowledge production, and medical decision-making; and the structure of the social institutions that comprise the health care industry.

Moving to the second part, we delve into the post-conflict stage, exploring the legacies of these experiences. Relying on a curated collection of films reflecting life during and after civil war, we explore the human experience of conflict in a nuanced and personal manner. Additionally, we examine social scientific research, drawing from political science, economics, and psychology, to understand and explain these legacies.

Since at least the early 1990s, rapid economic growth, massive infrastructural projects, democratic transformations and global threats of climate change, have characterized the South Asian region. Such political, economic, and ecological processes come together to worsen the lives and livelihoods of marginalized people typically. They tend to intensify their vulnerability to environmental degradation, with historical structures of inclusion and exclusion profoundly shaping how natural resources are accessed and distributed. While the regional focus is on South Asia, at the heart of this course is a broader concern that environmental questions are always questions of equality and social justice. The class will examine how issues of justice and nature are framed within law and official policy debates, within social movements and right-based struggles, as well as within people's moral imaginations and everyday lives. The following questions will guide the class: •\tWhat environmental problems arose in South Asia through accelerated economic development across the 20th century and early 21st century?\n•\tWho suffered the most, why, and how were they affected, socially, culturally, and materially?\n•\tWhat strategies for justice and sustainability emerged? •\tHow is environmental justice understood across activists, policymakers, and ordinary people whose lives are most in danger?"],["Learning Objectives","1.\tStudents will be able to evaluate processes of economic development, conservation, and natural resource regimes, in terms of their consequences on people who live in places where these processes are received. 2.\tStudents will be able to describe complex social responses to environmental issues such as the rise of environmentalism and protest movements, everyday resistance, local conflicts, and legal disputes, with examples from South Asia. 3.\tStudents will be able to think through key themes in environmental justice such as displacement, dispossession, resource extraction, biodiversity loss, and ecological refugees.

What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level seminar delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two ideas related to \"the people.\" The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of this seminar, you should be able to… -\tDemonstrate the ability to recognize, understand, and distinguish prescriptive from descriptive issues, questions, and claims. -\tDemonstrate ability to identify the values presupposed by an outlook or discourse -\tRecognize the complexity of ethical issues; be able to consider and propose multiple alternative perspectives on such issues -\tUnderstand, and appreciate insights in multiple intellectual traditions -\tEngage in constructive, reflective dialogue about evaluative issues and demonstrate ability to communicate about them."],["Class Materials (Required)","Shmuel Nili, The People's Duty (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019).

What choices are the filmmaker making regarding camera, sound, and editing, and how do these choices affect viewers? Throughout the course, we will consider the ethics of depicting real people and traumatic events. We will also look at specific films in regard to their legal or societal impact. Assignments will include a series of short response papers and a substantial final project, which can take the form of either (up to the student) a ten to twelve-page paper or a six to twelve-minute film/podcast/media project. Projects should center on a legal topic. Ideas include but are not limited to, a paper that compares two films depicting the same criminal case or a polished/edited film interview with an individual connected to a crime or involved with the legal system (a defendant, a lawyer, a judge, a policeperson, etc.). Additional topics could center around mitigation films, viral crime videos, local courts, legal advocacy centers, or hybrid crime films.

In an increasingly migratory world, medieval concepts of climate-based race were proven false, giving rise to several chaotic centuries in search of a new explanation for visible human difference. As the transatlantic slave trade became a source of wealth for colonizing Europeans, the need to classify people into discrete groups intensified, leading to an array of artworks that used their materiality as an agent of racialization. We will concentrate on the construction of Whiteness, Blackness, and Indigeneity as co-constitutive forms, while using creative methods to consider the perspectives of Indigenous and African diasporic peoples often lost to the colonial archive. We will engage with scholars of critical race theory, Indigenous studies, and decolonial thought as we interrogate themes such as: the Black/White binary and printmaking; monsters and cannibals in cartography; color in Indigenous codices; African sculptures of Portuguese colonizers; Black/Brownface in theater; and more."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbook required."]],"o":"6","f":"6"},{"i":"021600-50","r":[{"n":"Gregory Donald Manuel"}],"t":"Special Topics in the Humanities","k":"Disturbance, Disaster, Perspectives on Abrupt Chan","u":"HUM","n":"370-6","s":"50","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["AM Swift Krause Studio 103"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","Disturbance, Disaster, Event: Perspectives on Abrupt Change This course will track tactics and methods through which humans and nonhumans navigate quick moments of drastic social and environmental change.

It will focus on the role of aid in five main periods of U.S. foreign policy: 1) the Marshall Plan and the struggle for Europe (1945-1961), 2) superpower competition in the developing world (1961-1989), 3) aiding the transition to democratic governance (1989-present), 4) countering violent religious extremism in the Islamic world (2001-present), and 5) meeting the challenge of globalization (present day). We will look at how development aid emerged as a response to the superpower competition of the Cold War. The world's first major aid package, the Marshall Plan, was a key component in the U.S. strategy of containment: it was designed to prevent further Soviet encroachment into Central and Western Europe. With success of the Marshall Plan in Europe, Washington adopted foreign as a tool to contain the spread of Communism elsewhere, particularly in Southeast Asia and Latin America. With the end of the Cold War, the focus of development aid changed to reflect Washington's evolving strategic priorities. The collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe led to the danger of conflict and instability there, and presented the U.S. with the new challenge of aiding the newly independent states with their transition to democracy and the market economy. Congress responded with the Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) Act for Eastern Europe, and the FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) in the former Soviet Union. The attack of September 11, 2001 awoke Washington to the danger of violent Islamic extremism. As in 1989, Congress responded to the need to counter this phenomenon with new aid packages. In this section of the course, we will focus primarily on efforts to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, both during and after U.S. military action there. Finally, we will conclude by looking at how the challenges of globalization, particularly climate change and emerging health threats, are shaping today's foreign aid strategies. In the final week, students will present their ideas for future directions for foreign aid, in the form a briefing on their final project -- a set of recommendations on development policy for a hypothetical President."],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be based on class participation, including an oral briefing on the student's final project in the last week (30%), a short midterm essay on the role of the Marshall Plan in the eruption of the Cold War (20%, 3-5 pages), and a final paper (50%), where the student will develop a \"Policy Memorandum\" on strategies for a hypothetical new President.

Because race has been central to the forms of power and authority that first undergirded the colonial system and later birthed the many Latin American nations, we can trace a continued line of transmission of racialized ideologies that structure inequality in the region. Using a cultural and linguistic anthropological framework, we will approach these racial categories as composites of markers of otherness that include skin color, clothing, kin affiliations, occupation, among others. The course moves progressively from research about the early colonial period and forward chronologically until the 20th century, with a final discussion of migrant trajectories to the US.

Archaeologists, intellectuals, and imperial authorities worked together in the assemblage of important collections of all kinds of objects and treasures to be shipped, studied, and exhibited in Europe. Under the premise of scientific inquiry, a Western authorized network of experts and institutions provided the legal and academic framework to justify the permanency of those collections in European and North American soil. After World War II, the rise of UNESCO and the origin of the concept of \"World Heritage\" drastically transformed the ways of relating to cultural heritage and the notions of legal and historical ownership, favoring the European custody of spoiled collections. Nowadays, contemporary attempts by communities of former colonies to reclaim stolen objects have destabilized these authorized discourses of heritage. The course will explore the relationship and interaction between the Global North and the Global South around the categories of cultural heritage, particularly through the ongoing debates surrounding the repatriation of objects and collections from elite museums and institutions in Europe and North America to Latin America and Africa. Through several case studies including the Benin bronzes, the Quimbaya treasure, and the Parthenon marbles among others, students will be encouraged to critically engage with current discussions on heritage and museum studies, decolonial theory and international politics and diplomacy, as to find and do research on cases of their own interest from around the world."]]},{"i":"016391-21","r":[{"n":"Maya Novak-Herzog"}],"t":"Integrating Project Seminar","k":"The Politics of Sexuality","u":"INTL_ST","n":"395-0","s":"21","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Locy Hall 305"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"SEM","a":2,"p":[["Overview of class","Course title: The Politics of Sexuality Instructor: Maya Novak-Herzog This course takes the study of sex as its primary analytical subject-- what is sex?

By focussing on the different stages of the process of Nation building in Italy, the course also aims to make students aware of how Italy's national identity developed: two books (Foscolo's and Collodi's) were written in the 19th century, and will help students to understand the pre-Risorgimento (the making of Italy), and the post-Risorgimento (the making of the Italians); whereas the other two books (Calvino's and Tomasi's) come from the 20th century, and will help students to understand the Resistenza (the making of the Republic), and the post-war Italy (the crisis of nationhood). The course also aims to discuss the problem of the absence of a national hero in the Italian literary tradition, such as Wilhelm Tell for Switzerland or D'Artagnan for France or Robin Hood for Britain."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the course students will have an understanding of the process of Nation making in Italy through the last two centuries.

The course offers a reading of the most important poem of the Italian Renaissance, the Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto (1532). The poem will be placed against the background of the great events of its time, from the European colonization of the Americas (1492) to the Protestant Reformation (1517), in the context of Este Ferrara and the Italian wars. Through the direct reading of the most significant episodes, students will learn to connect the text and the context, focusing above all on some decisive aspects of Italian Renaissance culture: the contrast between magnificence and crisis; the opening of new perspectives on the social and cultural role of women; the birth of national states and the role of the leader in politics; the presence of a new gender dialectic, which paves the way for modern horizons; the importance of ethical and religious issues. The poem will therefore be read in dialogue with other great classics of its time, such as The Prince by Machiavelli (1513) and The Courtier by Baldassar Castiglione (1528)."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the course students will have a critical understanding of the meaning of the Italian Renaissance.

We will begin the class with learning about the origins of Yiddish and its development into becoming the most widespread Jewish language in Europe. We will then fast forward to the 18th and 19th centuries and the era of secularization among Jewish communities, where Western European Jews saw Yiddish as a degraded language while among Eastern European Jews Yiddish became a language of bursting literary expression and flourishing literature. Persecution, poverty, the dissolution of becoming part of intellectual Europe, and Zionist ideology were all reasons for many young Jewish people to immigrate to the US and Palestine in the first decades of 20th century. While Jewish immigrants in the United States sought connections to Yiddish and clinged to it as a remnant of their old world, Yiddish was rejected in Palestine (and later in Israel) as representing the \"old and weak Jew\" and threatening the status of Hebrew. We will examine the texts of major Yiddish writers from the beginning of the 20th century in the literary centers of Yiddish at the time; Eastern Europe, United States, and Palestine. An important part in our class will be the geographical move of Yiddish from its \"natural\" habitat of Eastern Europe to the US and Palestine, and the element of loss and grief which was strongly present in the writing of Yiddish poets and authors, during the upheavals in Europe in the two World Wars, and especially after the Holocaust. Class materials will be comprised of articles and book chapters to provide the historical, cultural, and political context of the eras we will discuss, and of essays, short stories, and poems translated from Yiddish to English.

This more recent history includes geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional water resources in the context of current and future climate and geopolitical conflicts, review recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations, and explore potential social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in the Middle East. We will discuss how water access and control contributes to trans-boundary politics and tensions between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the west Bank and Gaza, along with collaborative solutions developed between Israel and Jordan. Finally, we will discuss opportunities for global translation of innovative water technologies and water-management solutions.

Courts throughout the continent tried and punished hundreds of thousands for having worked with and for Germany and the Axis powers. By and large, however, those trials concentrated on crimes of political collaboration and paid little attention to what is now accepted as the Nazis' greatest crime: the genocide of European Jewry. Although courts did punish some architects of the so-called Final Solution, thousands of Europeans who had organized, perpetrated or otherwise contributed to the Holocaust escaped with minimal penalties or no punishment at all. Over the subsequent decades individuals, organizations, and states have sought to redress the failure to seek out and punish those perpetrators at war's end. Lawyers have prosecuted and defended accused war criminals before courts. Historians have documented the development and execution of genocide, while others have sought to deny the very murders themselves. Through the examination of a series of trials, the first half of the course will discuss both the struggle to bring perpetrators to justice and the efforts to obscure the crimes that had been committed.

Meanwhile, those who land law jobs have different challenges: recent surveys report many attorneys' growing disenchantment with their work and dissatisfaction with their lives. This seminar will examine the profession's multidimensional crisis. What changes occur in attorneys, both individually and systemically, emerging from law schools and finding their roles in the legal realm? Why is working within the most lucrative big firms now regarded by many as the pinnacle of private practice? What other options are available? It will explore life after law school, examining the disparate places law graduates might find themselves.

The idea of studying random walks on graphs as electrical networks was first introduced by Kakutani in the 1940's and later popularized by Doyle and Snell. The analogy reveals interesting connections between certain laws of physics, discrete harmonic functions, and the study of reversible Markov chains. Quantities such as access times, commute times, and escape probabilities for random walks can be phrased and often very efficiently computed in the language of electrical networks. For infinite graphs, a highlight application of the electrical network approach will be an elegant proof of Pólya's famous Recurrence Theorem for random walks on lattices from 1921.

A part of the course will be the theory of Ind-sheaves that is used there. I hope to put it into a more general context. The sheaf side of the general Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, i.e. enhanced sheaves, are related to and inspired by Dima Tamarkin's sheaf theoretical microlocal construction of a category associated to the cotangent bundle of a manifold (and, more generally, to a sympplectic manifold). We will outline at least some of those connections. We also could devote some time to D-modules in positive characteristic.

The erosive effects of this porosity in the age of the multi-national corporations heralded the death of the nation-state. Yet, in the epoch of border walls and offshored refugee processing centers, this assumed porosity of borders begs a reexamination of broader geographies of power and tactics of movement. In this course, we ask: What is a border? Is it the physical line drawn between two states? When is a border artificial and when natural? Who gets to draw these lines? How does the border become an architecture of regulation that extends access to mobility to some and denies it to others? We will probe these questions by working towards rethinking borders as equally the products of mobile social actors, contraband commodities and fluctuating values as they are of state policies aimed at managing their movements. By the end of the course students will be exposed to diverse theories of space and formations of borders in the Americas, Europe, and South Asia.

The Ottoman dynasty transformed the ancient Byzantine metropolis of Constantinople into the material embodiment of its imperial ambitions over Europe, Africa, and Asia. Yet these top-down efforts to recast Istanbul in the Ottoman image did not go unchallenged by Istanbulites themselves, who imagined alternative social orders for their city and reappropriated urban spaces as sites of public resistance.

Ethical and Evaluative Thinking:\n• Attain the conceptual tools needed to recognize and understand prescriptive issues, questions and claims, and to distinguish them from descriptive issues, questions, and claims: we will examine how evaluative claims (e.g., the perfection of God) were often used to underpin descriptive claims about the nature of the universe and the human mind.\n• Identify the values presupposed by an outlook or discourse: we will examine some of the central developments in early modern philosophy, as religious points of view gave rise to, as well as conflicted with, the emerging scientific perspective. • Recognize the complexity of many ethical issues and consider a variety of alternative resolutions and the reasons for holding them: we will look at a variety of ethical and evaluative issues (e.g., the problem of evil, the case for religious toleration, and the ethical foundations of personal identity), as well as their impact on broader philosophical systems. • Appreciate the insights available in one or more intellectual or cultural traditions: we will look at the intersections and divergences between various intellectual and cultural traditions, including the Reformation, the rise of early modern science, and the emergence of secularism in the Enlightenment; we will also look at how these developments appear from the point of view of some non-European philosophers. • Reflect upon one's own answers to evaluative questions, the presuppositions informing them, and the reasons supporting them: we will develop our own interpretations of, and responses to, the early modern philosophers we read, and we will develop our own views about the issues they consider, while uncovering the ways in which our presuppositions may differ from theirs.\n• Engage in respectful, rigorous, and constructive dialogue concerning evaluative issues and communicate thoughtfully and clearly about them: we will engage in a variety of individual and group activities that will foster a capacity for critical, charitable discussion, both verbally and in writing."],["Evaluation Method","Reading Reports Final exam in class."],["Class Materials (Required)","Readings In Modern Philosophy, Vol. 1, edited by Roger Ariew and Eric Watkins.

What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level course delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two moral ideas related to \"the people.\" The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy."],["Learning Objectives","Students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy."],["Evaluation Method","- Active participation (50 percent)\n- 1500 words paper initiating class discussion in one session\n- Expanded version of short paper"],["Class Materials (Required)","Shmuel Nili, The people's duty (Cambridge University Press, 2019), ISBN 9781108480925"]],"f":"5"},{"i":"002634-21","r":[{"n":"Shmuel Nili","a":"Scott Hall, Room 20","o":"http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/shmulik-nili.html"}],"t":"Topics in Social and Political Philosophy","u":"PHIL","n":"361-0","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Scott Hall 201 Ripton Room"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."}]},{"i":"021210","c":"WCAS","t":"Business and Professional Ethics","u":"PHIL","n":"364-0","s":[{"i":"021210-20","r":[{"n":"Lendell Chad Horne"}],"t":"Business and Professional Ethics","u":"PHIL","n":"364-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 318"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":20,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Juniors & Seniors Reserved for Seniors and Juniors.","p":[["Overview of class","Do corporations have moral obligations that extend beyond mere compliance with law?

When we consider terms like \"women\", \"brown-eyed people\", \"the Republican Party\", \"the working class\", and \"the Civil Rights Movement,\" we see that each purports to refer to a single unit composed of multiple people---but in each case, what it is that binds the relevant people together such that they appear to us as a unified entity is different in kind. Some forms of collectivity require that all constituent individuals have some antecedent trait in common, while some unite erstwhile dissimilar individuals. Some depend on people conceiving of themselves as unified, while some do not depend on individuals' mental states at all. And determining which flavor of collectivity a given entity instantiates is important for answering further practically and philosophically important questions: is the collective the kind of thing that can bear duties, or to which it makes sense to have reactive attitudes? Is it the kind of entity that we should strive to create, or which will figure in the explanation of social change? Readings will include work on grouphood, collective intentionality, and the grounding of social facts, as well as discussions of both ontological and explanatory varieties of the individualism/holism debate."],["Learning Objectives","Students will develop a familiarity with contemporary debates in social metaphysics and philosophy of the social sciences."],["Class Materials (Required)","All class materials will be available on Canvas at NO cost to the student.

First, utilitarian moral and political philosophy and its critics; second, the relationship between sovereignty, authority, and the law. Each of these themes is presented in a way that puts center-stage practical questions concerning both individual conduct and institutional design. By the end of the course you should have a good sense of the major claims and debates pertaining to each of these areas of moral and political theory."],["Learning Objectives","Core issues and modes of argument in contemporary political philosophy, with some historical background"],["Evaluation Method","- Active class participation (in lecture and especially section)\n- Three five-page papers."]],"o":"735","f":"3"},{"i":"015217-60","t":"Introduction to Political Theory","u":"POLI_SCI","n":"201-0","s":"60","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 213"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"DIS","o":"735","f":"3"},{"i":"015217-61","t":"Introduction to Political Theory","u":"POLI_SCI","n":"201-0","s":"61","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 305"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"DIS","o":"735","f":"3"},{"i":"015217-62","t":"Introduction to Political Theory","u":"POLI_SCI","n":"201-0","s":"62","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 305"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"DIS","o":"735","f":"3"},{"i":"015217-63","t":"Introduction to Political Theory","u":"POLI_SCI","n":"201-0","s":"63","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Lunt Hall 101"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"DIS","o":"735","f":"3"}]},{"i":"002768","c":"WCAS","t":"American Government and Politics","u":"POLI_SCI","n":"220-0","s":[{"i":"002768-20","r":[{"n":"Matthew R Pryor"}],"t":"American Government and Politics","u":"POLI_SCI","n":"220-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Harris Hall 107"],"d":"2024-03-26","e":"2024-06-01","c":"LEC","a":120,"p":[["Overview of class","This course introduces students to the study of U.S. government, politics, and policy.

In the 2020 election former Vice President Joe Biden soundly defeated incumbent president Donal Trump in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. Trump, lying about the voter fraud he claims occurred, has not concede the election. In 2016 polls showed Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote yet Donald Trump emerged victorious in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. In 2008 America elected its first African American President, Barack Obama and reelected him in 2012. In 2000 George W. Bush also lost the popular vote but he was ultimately chosen the victor by the Supreme Court. The fallout from the recount and the Supreme Court decision that gave Bush the victory is still being debated and studied.

We will also examine the 2008 campaign, which was dubbed the \"YouTube\" election and was historic by virtue of its outcome, the candidates who ran and the impact the Internet and new technologies had on the race. In 2012 the Obama campaign had the most intense \"ground game\" of any campaign in history, we will examine how the campaign succeeded in this effort. In 2016 Donald Trump bypassed typical advertising methods of reaching voters by unleashing a torrent of Twitter messages and finding a willing press that was at least in the primaries, willing to give him uncritical or challenging coverage.

Indeed, it has become increasingly obvious that achievement of Paris temperature objectives will require both aggressive emission reduction initiatives and large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal/negative emissions technologies and processes (CDR), sometimes also referred to as a major sub-category of climate geoengineering. Moreover, many believe that we will also need to deploy solar radiation management approaches, which seek to reduce the amount of incoming solar radiation, to buy us time as we decarbonize the world economy. This course will discuss the exigency of deploying SRM and CDR approaches at scale, including potential benefits and risks of these options.

Africans and their descendants have shaped virtually every aspect of Brazilian culture, history, and society. So why focus on Afro-Brazilian literature? How do we define it, and what does it have to say about Black history, Black identity, and Black lives in Brazil? To explore these questions, students will analyze English-language translations of Afro-Brazilian fiction, poetry, testimony, theory, graphic novels, documentary, and song lyrics. These texts reveal the central role of Afro-Brazilian women in the construction of Afro-Brazilian literature. By the end of the course, students will be able to name some of the most influential Afro-Brazilian authors and make meaningful connections and comparisons between their rich and multifaceted works. Students will also be able to write and talk about how Black authors have challenged racism and intersecting structures of oppression in a global context from the 19th century to the present.

To understand human behavior, we will take a truly interdisciplinary approach - drawing from a vast literature both within psychology (e.g., social, developmental, cognitive, political, and educational psychology) and across disciplines (e.g., law, health communications, consumer marketing).

Our exploration of consumer psychology will draw on theories of memory, emotion, attitudes, decision making, and motivation. Along the way, you will be introduced to interesting findings from basic research in consumer psychology, as well as \"real world\" examples involving businesses and brands.

From those who faint at the sight of it, to those who love vampire movies and gory thrillers, to those who study and analyze it in labs, this strange substance serves as a constant source of conflict, anxiety, and ideology. Representations of blood in Christian art, literature, and theology have been just as fraught. Ancient and medieval Christians saw the substance as alternately miraculous and polluting, life-giving and death-bringing, a marker of difference and a symbol of unity. Blood had the capacity to reveal whether a person was sick or healthy, whether they were sexually active, what god they worshipped, and even whether they were guilty of murder. If it was shed on a battlefield it was considered valiant; if it was shed from the bodies of virgins or martyrs it was considered holy; if it was shed during childbirth or menstruation it was considered polluting; and if it was shed in pursuit of love it was considered romantic. The Christian language of blood and blood purity crept into developing ideas about race and sexuality, forging links between morality and embodiment that have in turn informed understandings of biology and human difference. In this class, we will explore these complex and often contradictory representations of blood and bloodshed in Christian history.

That October, three Jewish women brought a lawsuit arguing that Kentucky's ban violated their religious freedom, writing, \"Jews have never believed that life begins at conception.\" In Missouri, an interfaith group of Christian and Jewish religious leaders filed a similar suit to block their state's abortion ban. And in Idaho and Indiana, the Satanic Temple did the same. These lawsuits illustrate how religious views on abortion are varied and complex.

What, in other words, might an engagement with beauty and related concepts tell us about being human and living a meaningful life? Although the idea of beauty has long been exiled from art theory and aesthetic theory, it remains a vital concept in daily life that points to commonly-experienced moments of special significance. For a number of artists, thinkers, religious traditions (e.g., Kashmiri Śaivism, Zen Buddhism) and cultures (e.g., Diné; Yoruba), beauty and related concepts have been central to a general understanding of what gives human life meaning and signficance. This class will explore practices, philosophies, religious traditions and cultures for which the experience of beauty (and closely related concepts) is of particular or greatest importance. What does it mean to put experiences of beauty at (or near) the center of human existence, to consider them to be uniquely and profoundly meaningful? How might this affect our sense of what it means to be human? And how have such dispositions served to connect humans in different times and places to presences, communities, and powers beyond (or within) the everyday?

In recent years, the public spotlight has cast light on savory and unsavory aspects of masculinity; think about the rise of the term \"toxic masculinity,\" the #MeToo movement, the 2019 viral Gillette advertisement, and blogs commenting on the behavior of men on the reality show The Bachelorette. In this course, we will go beyond banal statements like \"men are trash\" to critically ask, What role does masculinity play in social life? How is masculinity produced, and are there different ways to be masculine? This course provides students with an intensive introduction to the foundational theory and research in the field of masculinities studies. We will use an intersectional lens to study the ways in which the concept and lived experience of masculinity are shaped by economic, social, cultural, and political forces.

This class explores the ways our social networks shape society, and how society shapes our social networks. Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to both a theoretical perspective and a set of methodological techniques. As a theoretical perspective, SNA stresses the interdependence among social actors. This approach views the social world as patterns or regularities in relationships among interacting units and focuses on how such patterns affect the behavior of network units or actors. A \"structure\" emerges as a persistent pattern of interaction that can influence a multitude of behaviors, such as getting a job, income attainment, political decision making, social revolutions, organizational merges, global finance and trade markets, delinquent youth behaviors, the spread of infectious diseases, and so on. As a methodological approach, SNA refers to a catalog of techniques steeped in mathematical graph theory and now extending to statistical simulation, and algebraic models.

Entrenched health epidemics around gun violence, addiction, and police brutality regularly vie for our focus. Likewise, myths and moral panics about crime, when taken to the extreme, extend punitive action deep into our social fabric in the name of protecting individual and public health. This course delves into these intricate connections linking crime, health, and social control. We will spend much of our time together examining three interrelated topics. At the center of this course is how different groups experience crime and health and the role social institutions play in abetting and reproducing these processes. We will also examine what behaviors become criminalized and why - from abortion to drug use and sexual behavior. Finally, we will explore which of the behaviors defined as criminal are punished and, just as importantly, how laws around criminal behavior are unevenly enforced.
