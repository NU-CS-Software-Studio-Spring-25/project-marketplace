This foreign \"occupation\" continues well into the 19th century, but by the second half of that century begins to yield to a vigorous new school of French composers who created a series of extraordinarily successful works. Some of these (Bizet's Carmen) are still popular today, others have faded somewhat (Gounod's Faust, Massenet's Manon), and still others have virtually vanished from the repertoire (Mignon by Ambroise Thomas, Lakmé by Leo Delibes). Amid these shifting sands, the tradition of grand opera as embodied in the works of Halévy and Meyerbeer have undergone a strong reassessment, while at the opposite end, the operettas of Offenbach carry on in an absurd, satirical, and delightful world of their own. In this course, we will explore a selection of these works against the background of French history from Napoleon to the end of the 19th century. Along the way we will examine the work of important librettists (Eugène Scribe, Jules Barbier, Henri Meilhac, Ludovic Halévy) and compare the literary and theatrical works which served as a basis for plots with their operatic adaptations."],["Evaluation Method","EVALUATION will be based on three written assignments (25 points each), a final take-home examination (20 points) due for submission no later than Thursday March 17 at 9:00 AM, and class participation (5 points); your contributions to class discussion should be based on a thorough assimilation of the reading, listening, and viewing assignments you'll be given along the way, in addition to whatever original insights you're prepared to share.

As a thought experiment, consider a listener encountering some piece in very unfamiliar style: how would she make use of not only discrete pitch structures but also instrumentation, register, rhythm, and other parameters to guide the way into comprehending the music? We will take a full-spectrum auditory view of a wide range of music: pop songs, electroacoustic compositions, 20th-century music, and will focus on how 'surface' parameters serve to enliven and guide listening toward areas of significance in the musical structure."],["Registration Requirements","Upper level standing and musical background including reading normal clefs and at least the equivalent of first-year music theory.

In the US, penal control has become the main social response to crime. However, during the last few decades, some competing notions of justice have emerged and been applied in criminal legal systems. These notions include procedural justice, therapeutic-oriented justice, problem-solving justice, community-based justice, and restorative justice. Using a comparative lens, this course will introduce a variety of therapeutic, restorative, and problem-solving mechanisms that have been developed and implemented in criminal justice systems both in the US and worldwide. We will explore the potential of the criminal justice system by adopting non-punitive notions of justice to achieve goals that go beyond its classic, traditional goals, such as enhancing the well-being of its various stakeholders, empowering communities, restoring relationships between law-breakers and victims, encouraging reconciliation, and providing holistic rehabilitation to offenders. The course will address the tension between the criminal justice system's traditional goals and the therapeutic-oriented goals. We will discuss the question of whether the criminal justice system is the right domain to promote therapeutic goals given the potential risks of net-widening, stigmatization and its collateral consequences, deprivation of due process rights, paternalism, and coercion that arise when therapeutically oriented goals are promoted within the criminal legal regime, especially in societies that suffer from racial and socio-economic inequalities."],["Evaluation Method","10 - Mandatory Attendance\n60 - Active and significant class participation (significant engagement during class discussions and activities, speaking in class, referring to reading materials, contributing ideas and reflections)\n20 - Response paper and presentation of a supplementary reading assignment\n10 - Short Reflection paper"],["Class Notes","This course will be taught in a condensed way to pedagogically maximize experiential learning and to enable the students to develop an understanding of the multi-dimensional notion of justice in the criminal legal context. The course consists of 5 days (an online Zoom meeting on December 26th + four days of in-person instruction on January 6-10), each focusing on various distinct meanings of justice in the criminal sphere. Each meeting contains learning units that are connected and correspond with each other. The discussions in each of the meetings will be based on the observations and insights gained in previous meetings. Due to the broad timeframe of each meeting, the students will be able to engage deeply and thoroughly with ideas and critiques that relate to each of these notions and establish a comprehensive understanding of each of these notions and their interplays. The timeframe devoted to each meeting would allow us to combine theoretical learning with experiential activities, creating a sequence of learning experiences that a scattered course cannot provide. Sessions of theoretical discussion on abstract principles will be followed by class activities, such as watching documentaries and videos and analyzing them together; working in small groups on hypothetical or illustrative cases, and conducting a restorative community circle in class."]]}]},{"i":"018978","c":"LAW","t":"Advanced Negotiation Workshop","u":"LITARB","n":"672","s":[{"i":"018978-1","r":[{"n":"Lynn P Cohn","p":"312/503-2598","a":"420 E.

ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year. This course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by \"synthesis\" starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of \"analysis\" to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous \"territories\": viscous flows, inviscid flows, \"almost\" inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this \"landscape\", theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems. In ME 241 (a prerequisite for this course) the concept of a fluid and its properties was introduced. The subject was then developed by a method of \"synthesis\" by systematically applying Newton's laws to fluid elements culminating in the fundamental equations of fluid flow — the Euler system of equations (if the fluid is inviscid) or the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of viscous flows. In this course we follow a complementary approach. After giving a brief review of the fundamental equations of fluid flow, we use the method of \"analysis\" to unravel the physical content of these equations. In the process, we learn about a variety of fluid phenomena and its applications such as: supersonic flow and the principles of design of jet engines, viscous boundary layers and the consequent drag on airplane wings, the concept of vorticity and how it describes phenomena such as tornadoes etc. Topics Include: • Steady viscous flows (exact solutions) Poiseuille flow in round pipes Couette flow between parallel plates\n• Inviscid flows concept of vorticity and the generalized Bernoulli theorem irrotational (or potential) flows - the velocity potential and the stream function\n• Compressible layers one dimensional isentropic flows - the Laval nozzle Shocks\n• Boundary layers Prandtl's boundary layer theory for \"almost\" inviscid flows"],["Registration Requirements","Prerequisite: MECH_ENG 241."],["Evaluation Method","Homework, Mid-term, Take-home exam, Final exam."],["Class Materials (Required)","Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, Munson, Young, Okiishi, 6th edition, Wiley 2009, ISBN 9780470262849"]]},{"i":"005225-60","t":"Engineering Fluid Mechanics","u":"MECH_ENG","n":"373-0","s":"60","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute M177"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS"}]},{"i":"005226","c":"MEAS","t":"Heat Transfer","u":"MECH_ENG","n":"377-0","s":[{"i":"005226-20","r":[{"n":"Manohar Ramchandra Kulkarni","p":"847/467-6741","a":"Technological Institute, Rm B290, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS"}],"t":"Heat Transfer","u":"MECH_ENG","n":"377-0","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute L251"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":50,"p":[["Overview of class","Fundamentals of heat transfer by conduction, convection, radiation.

Students in this course must apply for select spots in this class by filing the Medill Illinois News Bureau - Winter Application in November and getting accepted into the class in advance as MINB Fellows. The course will prepare eight to ten admitted students to report on all aspects of local and state government and Illinois and national politics. Stories will range from breaking news and light enterprise to features, investigative and deeper dive stories covering the Illinois and Chicago news beats. This includes state government officials and agencies, the Illinois General Assembly, the governor's office and the executive branch, and even some stories on the Illinois Supreme Court, as well as stories about Chicago's City Hall, Chicago Public Schools and Chicago news conferences with an Illinois focus. This class will include students in the Politics, Policy and Foreign Affairs specializaiton and also students from other MSJ specializations—and some of those latter students may want to apply to contunue with the advanced reporting class on the Statehouse Beat in the Spring Quarter that will continue using MINB Fellows to work on stories and beats with Capitol News Illinois. Students will be required to travel to Springfield regularly when the legislature is in session, and students will be getting invaluable, on-the-ground experience reporting from the Illinois State Capitol. This also means students admitted to this class should not schedule classes on Wednesdays in the Winter Quarter to allow for Tuesday-Thursday travel to Springfield on any given week. Students will explore reporting assignments with Medill's partner, Capitol News llinois (CNI), and work through an innovative new Medill bureau to place stories with CNI.

MINB Fellows started working in the Falll Quarter publisihing stories for CNI, and Fellows will continue publishing there through the winter, spring and summer quarters. There will be a new adminstraiton taking office on Jan. 20, and the students may cover aspects of state government and politics that intersect with that new adminsration and its policies. American politics in the 21st Century have become increasingly divided, bitter and rancorous, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by a violent mob storming the U.S. Capitol and an attempt by members of Congress to undo the lawful result of the 2020 presidential election. Protests in Chicago and Milwaukee during the 2024 Democratic and Republican National Conventions underscored the divisions in the heartland and across the U.S. on issues ranging from the war in Gaza to the fight over abortion rights. The 2024 presidential campaign that played out during this Fall Quarter may still be reverberating through state and local government during Winter Quarter, and this course will provide excellent lessons in real time for discussion, brainstorming and producing stories on state and local government and national politics, how to cover them and the bitter partisanship gripping the country."],["Class Materials (Required)","We will use mostly stories and links from news outlets on the Web for coursework and homework, but there is one required book: \"Illinois Politics: A Citizen's Guide to Power, Politics, and Government\" by Melissa Mouritsen, Kent D.

This winter-quarter course is a mandatory component of the Medill Investigative Lab-Chicago, where we will begin the team investigation that will be completed during a 2-credit spring-quarter course. In 2023 and 2024, the Medill investigative Lab-Chicago worked with MindSite News and other media partners on stories investigating police response to mental health crises, with students traveling to report in locations including Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Rapid City and Minneapolis. A similar topic will continue to be our focus in 2025. In 2022, the Medill Investigative Program produced a series of investigations of toxic coal ash, published by Energy News Network and Detroit Public TV and including a TV feature. Students traveled to report in locations including Montana, New York, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee. In this program, we use investigative tools and techniques including FOIAs and public records, court documents, data, mapping, on-the-ground scouting, interviews and other research to shed light on injustice and inequity. We will use a social justice and solutions journalism lens, exploring, quantifying and chronicling how the policies and practices of government agencies, corporations or other entities impact real people, and how things might be changed for the better.

A journalist covering a protest over the death of George Floyd files a federal lawsuit accusing police of violating his First and Fourth Amendment rights for spraying him with a chemical agent.

How do writers craft engaging narratives across different mediums, and how do directors ensure their vision resonates with the audience? This course delves into the science and art of audience engagement by combining two key perspectives: neuroscientific research and creative writing. Through an interdisciplinary approach, students will explore audience reactions to various genres (comedy, drama, horror) and mediums (film, TV, audio, theater), examining both the scientific principles that drive audience engagement, and the creative strategies used to capture attention. Coursework will alternate between analyzing scientific research on audience responses and studying the structural elements of storytelling across genres and mediums. Writing exercises will allow students to apply these insights to their own creative work. Readings may include The Play Was Always the Thing: Drama's Effect on Brain Function, The Science of Screenwriting, Neurocinematics: The neuroscience of film, among others. The course will also feature field trips to a neuroscience lab and a theater, where students will interact with technologies that capture both individual and collective audience experiences in real time.

The first objective is to try to understand how and why \"democracy\" today has come to be regarded as the only \"legitimate\" form of government. This was not always the case. After a brief and dramatic appearance more than two thousand years ago in the ancient Greece, \"democracy\" was regarded more often negatively as a dangerous and unstable form of government susceptible excesses of both \"voice and violence.\" However, starting in the late eighteenth century in the aftermath of two great revolutions, the American and the French, followed by the end of the Second World War in 1945 and the end of the Cold War in 1991, democracy has had a series of spectacular ascents. Today democracy is seen as the only viable and legitimate form of \"self-governance\" and as an expression of \"popular sovereignty.\" How did this happen? The second objective is to examine the growing disenchantment with democracy in the very midst of its triumphal march. The discontent with democratic governance is no longer confined to \"new democracies\" in poor or developing countries where they are often afflicted with massive corruption, demagogic leadership, and electoral violence and fraud. Increasingly mature democracies in advanced countries in Europe and North America are also suffering from a legitimacy deficit due to issues related to economic inequality, a high rate of unemployment or chronic under-employment, immigration, racial and religious conflicts. This is evident from the resurgence of populism, especially authoritarian versions of populism, in recent decades in many parts of the world. This, in turn, has given rise to growing chatter about the coming death of democracy. In this course, we will primarily focus on the following question: How can these two seemingly contradictory claims about democracy- the reports about its impending death and need for its continuing existence for securing legitimacy to govern- plausibly coexist and have currency in political discourse and thinking today."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbook required."]]}]},{"i":"019801","c":"SPCH","t":"Technology & Human Interaction","u":"COMM_ST","n":"351-0","s":[{"i":"019801-1","r":[{"n":"Darren Robert Gergle"}],"t":"Technology & Human Interaction","u":"COMM_ST","n":"351-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 2107"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":25,"p":[["Overview of class","Facebook and Twitter provide persistent services for exchanging personal information, Snaps can be compiled into stories that provide insight about your last 24 hours, ubiquitous and tangible computing environments allow objects to adapt to our everyday experiences, and new collaboration technologies enable people to work together on projects when they are thousands of miles apart.

Individuals and groups habitually settle into fixed perspectives, unchallenged mental models of how the world works, unconscious filters determining what we pay attention to and what we ignore. These habits offer powerful economies of thought: without them, the simplest task of picking a face out in a crowd or listening to the radio while driving would be impossible. But they impose costs as well. They lock us into a single view of the world that may not be advantageous, that is surely incomplete, resistant to change, and likely to soon become outdated. Innovation involves trading off economy of thought for creativity of thought. It requires the discipline of interpreting what we see and hear in organizations from multiple standpoints. Accordingly, we will learn to analyze situations and craft implementation plans using three perspectives on organizations—strategic design, political and cultural. While leading change always presents challenges, our goal in this course is to use the three perspectives to develop a more complete understanding of these challenges and how to address them."]]},{"i":"004259-30","r":[{"n":"James J Schwoch"}],"t":"Topics in Communication Studies","k":"The New Outer Space","u":"COMM_ST","n":"395-0","s":"30","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 110"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","This course offers a selective, yet galactic, approach to investigating the contemporary conditions of outer space in 2020s and 2030s. No longer the semi-exclusive domain of a few powerful nations and a handful of rich corporations (although both remain very active), still grudgingly shared with scientists such as astronomers and earth scientists (now shared more grudgingly than ever before) what is increasingly called The New Outer Space involves activities by most of the nations of the planet, a huge range and diverse scale of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and inventors, and a largely uniformed public that knows little to nothing about The New Outer Space that is arriving for our future. We will look at issues such as the vanishing of dark and quiet skies as satellites increase in number and undermine astronomical research; plans to build telescopes on the Shielded (Dark) side of the Moon; the growing environmental problems of space debris returning to Earth and splashdown at Point Nemo, the rapidly filling oceanic graveyard of satellites; the competition for access to and control of Cislunar Space; whether and why The Moon needs its own time zone; mega-constellations of satellites that will grow to includes thousands of satellites in orbit; LEO, MEO, GEO and other orbits; new direct-to-smartphone satellites such as BlueWalker 3, at certain moments the 9th-brightest object in the skies of the Northern Hemisphere; Space Advertising with coordinated satellites depicting corporate logos and similar images; names and corporations you have likely heard of, such as Elon Musk and SpaceX, as well as activities likely unknown to many, such as the rising importance of New Zealand as a launch site; and why nations we do not often associate with outer space activities (Rwanda, Luxembourg, and many others) are now co-investing with industry start-ups for a huge and growing range of outer space activities. Assignments will include attendance, short papers, short in-class oral reports, and tracking and reporting on selected satellites, projects, and corporations. When weather conditions permit (generally clear skies and ice and snow free) the last hour of class will be held outdoors as we attempt to observe ISS, Tiangong, BlueWalker 3, and the ACS3 Solar Sail if and when these and other objects are visible in the Evanston night sky.

We will read five plays, including Julia Cho's Durango (2007), Young Jean Lee's Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven (2009), Chay Yew's Question 27, Question 28 (2004), Lloyd Suh's The Heart Sellers (2023), and Lauren Yee's Cambodian Rock Band (2018), while looking at Asian American social protest as performance. Students will be exposed not only to recurring themes but also to how each work interweaves individual experiences with the distinct cultural and sociopolitical landscapes of both the country of origin and the U.S. Topics we will investigate include, but are not limited to, colonialism, imperialism, immigration, war, trauma, memory, and the intersection of race, gender, sexuality, and class, as well as the power of art. In doing so, students will explore various performance forms (e.g., realism, documentary theatre, and social protest) and contemplate the different theatrical effects each brings to understanding the narrative and creating social impact.

During the years surrounding World War II, she made a national reputation performing with her company on Broadway and on the Hollywood screen. Then, in the decades following the war, she traveled internationally with her company, her work implicitly and explicitly engaging the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for decolonization.

Skilled educators continually take experiences from the field in the form of observations, curiosities, and challenges to inform structured inquiry—with the purpose of improving conceptual and pedagogical understandings for themselves and their students. MSED 407-1 & 407-2 are grounded in a model of action research. In our view, action research is not distinct from the work of teaching and educating, rather when done well it drives the work of teaching and learning. Data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings on a daily basis—we are responsible for mining and learning from them. As a result of these courses you will not only have designed and conducted action research— your Master's Project —but more importantly, you will have a set of stances and tools to embark on a career as an educator scholar who continues to notice various aspects of teaching and learning, ask important questions, and engage in meaningful, guided examinations of practice to evolve learning. The goal of MSED 407-1 and 407-2 is to help you become informed educators who are able to turn curiosities and challenges from your settings into potential areas of structured reflection and research. The basis of the course is the model of action research — of studying our own settings around questions we are passionate about, for the purpose of improving our students and colleagues learning as well as our own practice.

A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation. The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society.

We'll read and discuss key works in the philosophy of law from H.L.A.

The people who lived at Chan were ordinary farmers and the goal of research at Chan is to explore the importance of farmers¿ everyday lives. Starting in summer 2015, she is embarking on a new research project at the ancient Maya city of Aventura, also in Belize. Aventura is a city that survived the Maya collapse and may hold answers to how humans can create sustainable cities."}],"t":"Logic of Inquiry in Anthropology (Archy)","u":"ANTHRO","n":"401-2","s":"1","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"SEM","a":16,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students.","p":[["Overview of class","In this course students will examine the logic of inquiry in archaeology: the theories, methods, major epistemologies, and philosophies of archaeology. We will address two fundamental questions: Why is important to study the past? What is the role of the past in the present? Understanding our history and our heritage is crucial for the world today and key to understanding past ways of life. The course frames archaeology within anthropology and the humanities and sciences more broadly and examines the role of anthropology, humanities, and science within the discipline of archaeology. It addresses contemporary archaeological research and its promise for the future.\nArchaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains. A central focus of the course is on materiality as an archaeological method and a method that can be applied broadly within anthropology. Archaeology is a team-based, participatory discipline, a methodology of practice that has important implications for how archaeologists can work in partnership with local communities and address contemporary issues. Ethical, contemporary, and practice-based discussions will interweave across the course. In this course students will develop an original research project that applies archaeological approaches to material culture in their own research."],["Registration Requirements","1st and 2nd year graduate students in the Anthropology Department."],["Learning Objectives","1.

There have been attempts to find an adequate language for dance and ways to re-enact performance art more generally, but with changes in technology, the camera has become the witness for history, and thus photography is currently the main way that the live act can exist again. Importantly, the camera that moves around does not function as a distanced or neutral spectator. Rather, the presence and gaze of the camera functions to disrupt and challenge the space(s) of the live act. The archival technology does not simply record the performance but takes part in it as a participant, thus changing the very nature of the performance it documents. In this course students will investigate relationships between dance / performance art and its documentation in photography and video. We will study photography and film as they function as an indexical record of ephemeral, temporally fleeting phenomena and how this record becomes the basis for repetition and re-performance. This course focuses on the field of screendance, videodance, or dance-on-camera, working to define this hybrid genre and to understand the collaborative roles of choreographer, director, dancer, cameraman, and video editor. This course is both a practical and scholarly approach to the genre of screendance. Theoretical readings on film theory, performance art, and dance will situate famous works within their greater socio-cultural milieu as a way to investigate their impact on art practices, art spectatorship, and society. Through substantive analysis of course readings, assigned media, creative workshops, and attending live performances, students will develop the skills to analyze both theoretical arguments and works of art. Students will be asked to present on an artist who uses dance and performance in their work in an in-class presentation, write a short reflective paper, participate in movement workshops and create their own movement scores, recorded and edited on their personal media devices.

Broadly, the term refers to the collective efforts of cultural producers to respond to the ever-shifting conditions of perception and social life brought on by modernity. The course examines some of the key moments in global modernity from the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century. It provides a critical introduction to the rise of modern art practices from a range of locales, pushing against the hegemonic discourses upholding the Western canon to underscore the interdependencies between the Global North and the Global South. From anti-colonial modernism in India to considerations of race and modernism in mid-century Jamaica, this course takes seriously the diversity of experiences of global modernity by examining movements and moments formed in opposition to the ravages of capitalism, colonialism, industrialization, imperialism, and war that continue to define our world. We will examine how the aesthetic of newness, ideas of \"progress,\" and radical formal invention characteristic of modernism were rooted in the societal transformation of modernity. The work of the course contests the idea of modernism as a purely European or American phenomenon while considering artists' efforts to elaborate internationalist artistic languages, reflecting and refracting the concurrent rise of the modern nation-state. Across the quarter, we will focus on how modernist traditions transformed through their circulation across cities, nations, and continental borders. The overarching goal of this course is the consideration of how the formal concerns of distinct movements in modern art, responding to modernization, emerged out of specific historical and cultural contexts and how each movement pushed against the tastes of society at large to radically challenge ideas about art itself."],["Class Notes","Waitlist information for this course: https://arthistory.northwestern.edu/courses/2024-2025/registration_waitlist.html"]],"o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-2","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"2","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 213"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-3","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"3","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 213"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-4","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"4","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-430"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-5","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"5","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-430"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-6","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"6","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 213"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-7","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"7","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 213"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-8","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"8","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 305"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"},{"i":"018524-9","t":"Introduction to Modernism","u":"ART_HIST","n":"255-0","s":"9","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 305"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"476","f":"46"}]},{"i":"001240","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in Medieval Art","u":"ART_HIST","n":"329-0","s":[{"i":"001240-1","r":[{"n":"Bihter Esener"}],"t":"Special Topics in Medieval Art","k":"Medieval Mediterranean World","u":"ART_HIST","n":"329-0","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-335"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","This course explores the medieval Mediterranean world's art, architecture, archaeology, and material culture from late antiquity to the early modern period, or between the late 4th and 16th centuries.

The paintings and prints represented only the contemporary urban and suburban world (no history; no religion; no mythology) and in startingly novel ways: the pictures were brighter, more freely handled, and oddly evasive than any made before. The 2024 celebration of the 1874 exhibition's 150th birthday renewed interest in the history and meanings of Impressionism.

Secondly, and interconnected to these historical and economic shifts, we will adopt a historiographic perspective, questioning how the avant-garde has been depicted and acclaimed—assessed for meaning—for historians, artists, and collectives during various periods of transformation and resistance (and even revolution). Rather than drawing a strict division between the historical and so-called \"neo\" avant-garde movements, our aim is to recognize the continued exchanges and interplays between the avant-garde projects that preceded World War II and those that emerged after.

In a 2021 New York Times article titled \"From BTS to ‘Squid Game': How South Korea Became a Cultural Juggernaut,\" South Korea is described as an undeniable global soft power. However, this present success would have been difficult to imagine in the 1980s, when South Korean society largely viewed itself as a relatively \"undeveloped\" postcolonial nation, just beginning to recognize the strategic importance of its information and culture industries in the so-called age of post-industrialization. This course begins from that earlier historical moment to trace and understand the rise of South Korea's now-prominent cultural industries. A key question we will explore is the notion of national culture—specifically South Korean culture, which is inseparable from our critical reflection on the concept of national culture itself. In this sense, we can ask, \"What exactly is Korean about K-pop or K-drama?\" We'll examine how national culture, as a critical issue and a collective endeavor, is linked to postcolonial and Cold War-era nation-building projects, global debates on colonial legacies and U.S. cultural imperialism, and South Korea's push for globalization—shaped in part by U.S. pressure—since the 1990s (or the 1980s, considering earlier structural changes in economic and technological infrastructure). In addition to investigating \"Korean culture\" as a concept defined in various ways across different historical periods, the course encourages critical reflection on dichotomies such as national vs. global and East vs. West. These reflections are particularly relevant in a globalized context where the production, distribution, and consumption of K-pop and other forms of Korean media frequently transcend national boundaries, often engaging with and mediated by diasporic communities."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the class, students are expected to:\n1.

The night sky, the Sun and the solar system planets appear very different when observed with radio telescopes. Studying the invisible universe provides an awe in the diversity of phenomena that our universe offers. The realm of the invisible includes the components of the fascinating history of radio astronomy, and numerous discoveries over the last 90 years (e.g., pulsars, quasars, the Big Bang background radiation, organic molecules) and fundamental differences between visible and invisible night sky. Before 1931, the study of the universe was limited to optical observations of the night sky. Karl Jansky changed everything by building a radio telescope that could observe the sky day or night. We are all familiar with radio frequencies by listening to FM radio stations and using GPS satellites for navigation. Radio astronomy is the study of natural radio emission from celestial objects at frequencies outside FM and GPS frequencies. The human eye can see optical light but is blind to radio signals, including those that provide important clues about the history of our universe. The radio band is very broad, spanning 100,000 Hz between 10^7 to 10^12 Hz, whereas our eyes are only sensitive between red and blue, a factor of two. This course discusses new tools to unveil the `hidden' sky over a wide range of frequencies in ways that can not be viewed or understood in the optical frequencies."],["Registration Requirements","None required"],["Learning Objectives","This distro course is for undergraduate students who have no background in astronomy.

Patrick Johnson and Mae Henderson's seminal anthology Black Queer Studies was published by Duke University Press. The anthology brought together essays by scholars to assess the strengths and weaknesses of prior work on race and sexuality, highlighting the theoretical and political issues at stake in the nascent field of black queer studies. Following up with his groundbreaking edited collection, Johnson published No Tea, No Shade in 2016. Building on the foundations laid out in Black Queer Studies, No Tea, No Shade spoke new truths about the black queer people, and the black queer experience, whose radical imagination insist on always recalibrating blackness, its embodiment, and performance in an ever-changing political economy. The goal of this course is to problematize the terms \"queer,\" \"gender\" and \"sexuality,\" with efforts to question assumptions that attend the usage and deployment of these terms in discourse. This course primarily centers three groundbreaking black queer films - Barry Jenkins' Moonlight (2016), Dee Ree's Pariah (2009), and Kristen Lovell's The Stroll (2023) - as critical, popular, and accessible expressions of black queer theory. We will closely analyze each film alongside other popular culture forms - television shows, performance art, and other visual media - to think about how these texts are in conversation with one another and uncover topics related to black queer genders, sexual practices, vulnerability, queer cultural invisibility, sex work and survival, and LGBTQ kinship. This class will offer students an introduction into black queer theories, analytics, knowledge, and activism that emerge from LGBTQ people of color who examine the intersections of, primarily, race, class, gender, and sexuality, and other vectors of powers and categories of social life. Likewise, this course will expose students to black queer film and media and challenge us, within the academy, to close the gap between popular and academic meditations on black queer life."]]}]},{"i":"020272","c":"WCAS","t":"Literatures of the Black World","u":"BLK_ST","n":"211-0","s":[{"i":"020272-20","r":[{"n":"Nicole Adeyinka Spigner"}],"t":"Literatures of the Black World","k":"Black Gothic","u":"BLK_ST","n":"211-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-435"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":30,"p":[["Overview of class","When first hearing the word \"gothic,\" most would not think of Black authors and visual artists.

Also, we will look at nineteenth-century gothic fiction and poetry by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Pauline E. Hopkins, Adah Isaacs Menken, W.E.B. DuBois, and Charles Chesnutt.

The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector. The class is composed of 15 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations to work on quarter-long consulting engagements. Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector. To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management. Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends. The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits. The over-arching goal of the course is to create a foundation of knowledge from which students can draw upon as they work together with community non-profits.

These renowned poems were in conversation with narratives that circulated widely among neighboring Egyptian, Hebrew, Babylonian, Phoenician, and other ancient communities, in stories which not only produced echoes among themselves, but very likely borrowed from each other. In this seminar, we will read and discuss representative accounts of exile from the ancient Mediterranean world, highlighting their historical and geographical specificity but also reflecting on their treatment of common concerns and themes—such as homelessness and hospitality, longing and belonging, identity and otherness, hosts and guests, refugees and havens, pain and nostalgia, presence and absence, etc. While the seminar will highlight the historical and archaeological coordinates of those narratives, we will also reflect upon their relevance in discussing the very current reality of exilic life in today's world.

The anarchic space of the \"comedy\" genre is often understood to house a subversive potential, using absurdism or satire to scramble power dynamics or to question social norms governing gender, sexuality, race, and family. One standout question for us will be: Does the romantic comedy threaten to tame the comedy genre's subversive potential? Or does it promise to release its chaotic energies in ever renewed ways?

Photography's relation to memory, the medium's relationship to the unconscious, the changes mechanical reproducibility introduced for our aesthetic experiences, the social and political significance it acquired as a way to understand modern life and how it facilitates as well as shapes social relations, as well as how it allegorizes embodied and cognitive processes through which we engage the world are reflections that stem from his now famous essay.

With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes).

as a living artwork: \"good bodybuilders have the same mind in terms of sculpting that a sculptor has. You look in the mirror and say, ‘Okay, I need a little more deltoid to get the proportion right.' So you exercise and put those deltoids on, whereas an artist would just slap on some clay.\" In an age of Instagram Face and mail-order Ozempic, it's not unusual to think of our physical form as fundamentally malleable. But what are the stakes of understanding our bodies to be constructed and changeable objects? Should we celebrate what philosopher Paul Preciado calls \"bioempowerment,\" using our bodies to derail familiar gender norms? Does embracing bodily flexibility align us uncomfortably with an economy that demands ever more energy, availability, and agility from its workers? And where do the bodily norms against which we sculpt ourselves come from, anyway? Roving from the Renaissance anatomy theater to drive-through plastic surgery clinics, this course will explore some of the discourses, political structures, and material practices that shape our bodies, both physically and figuratively. Alongside theoretical texts, such as writing by Michel Foucault and Judith Butler, we will look at poems that dissect the bodies of their beloved, fiction by authors ranging from Mary Shelley to Jamil Jan Kochai, journalistic investigations into fatphobia, and films, dances, and visual artworks that use prosthesis and collage to rearrange familiar forms. In doing so, you will get the chance to think through how these texts are constructed, and investigate the ways that literary, visual, and physical forms influence one another.

One section of the anthology contains \"interior monologues,\" in which we seem to be inside the main character's head, overhearing his or her thoughts; another section contains \"dramatic monologues,\" in which we hear the narrator speaking aloud to another character; a third section contains \"epistolary\" stories (stories told in letters); a fourth contains stories that consist of diary entries; and so on.

In this course, we will explore swamps, bogs, and wetlands through a variety of mediums, including literary fiction (Jeff VanderMeer's Annihilation); television episodes (\"It's a Swamp Thing\" from Harley Quinn); and videogames (Dark Souls 3).

In this course, we'll examine various examples of worldbuilding, worldmaking—or, as Octavia Butler terms it, worldweaving. We'll analyze how writers evoke a sense of \"world\" across multiple scales through the ecologies, atmospheres, characters, politics, and languages that they craft. In the first few weeks of the course, we will discuss worldmaking through historical lenses, from creation myths and origin stories to medieval maps and early modern utopian fiction. Then, we will move onto more contemporary texts such as Tillie Walden's On A Sunbeam and Cathy Park Hong's Dance Dance Revolution, investigating how writers weave speculative worlds with lived experiences and discourses of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. By the end of the course, we will look to other mediums, such as video games and tabletop role-playing, to consider the immersive potential of worldmaking practices. This course is primarily a writing course. Writing comes into being not only through recording your thoughts on paper, but also through reading, analyzing, and engaging with the world around you.

For those uninitiated in the world of African American vernacular (AAV) , being bad is not always good thing. Yet, as many Black women know, being called \"bad\" is a compliment that speaks to not only appearance but a general aura that transcends language. The term boujee, a shortened version of bourgeois, is an insult for women who are seen as too high maintenance or demanding of the finer things in life. Yet, boujee can also be a desirable trait highlighting a woman's aspirational status. In this class, we will look at the multiple meanings of these terms in both their positive and negative connotations to critically engage the intersections between class, race, and gender in Black women's writing. Reading across a range of sources, including poetry, prose fiction, music and film, produced from 1900 to today, we will look at women who are imagined outside of the norms of Black American sociality: \"fast\" girls in New York City who were arrested for being too \"wayward,\" queer femmes who attempted to build relationships with each other rather than their husbands, and girls abandoned by their mothers that have to learn how to be bad all by themselves. Ultimately, we will assess the promise and peril that characterize Black women as bad and boujee.

In response to Taylor's outrage, Kim Kardashian released a recorded phone call between Taylor and Kanye in which she seemed to approve the controversial lyric, and called Taylor a \"snake.\" This suggestion of Taylor's deceit spread quickly through public opinion, and #TaylorSwiftisaSnake went viral across social media platforms. What does it mean to call a woman a snake? What does such a comparison seek to express about someone's intentions, or even their ethics? And what happens when women accused of sn(e)akiness lean into rather than away from the comparison? We will consider these questions in a winding investigation of snakey women through the ages and across a variety of narrative forms. From the bond between Eve and a serpent in the biblical story of Adam and Eve's fall from grace to the bond between dragon-rider Rhaenyra Targaryen and her dragon (HBO series, \"House of the Dragon\"), from Melusine, a medieval folkloric figure cursed with the body of a serpent from the waist down, to Medusa, the monstrous snake-haired woman of Greek mythology, this class will examine how premodern and modern representations of serpentine femininity treat issues of gender and power."],["Class Materials (Required)","Excerpts from the Old Testament; Ovid's Metamorphoses; Melusine; the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\"; and \"House of the Dragon\"; as well as selections from medieval illuminated manuscripts and social media."]],"o":"6","f":"6"},{"i":"024513-21","r":[{"n":"Rio Mckade Bergh"}],"t":"Literary Histories","k":"American Nightmare: Race Science from the 18th C t","u":"ENGLISH","n":"200-0","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["555 Clark 230"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","Topic: American Nightmare: Race Science from the 18th C to the Present Is the American dream only a white dream, even a fantasy? Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning 2017 horror film Get Out, in which a white liberal family systematically transplants the brains of their aging family members into the bodies of Black people, satirizes the postracial fantasy of colorblindness. White wealth and flourishing (and eternal youth) are based on a horrifying techno-fix: the exploitation and extraction of Black life, the production of a living nightmare. Peele's film raises unsettling questions about the American conception of race—questions with deep histories—which this class aims to explore: How has race been mobilized as a structure of white supremacist social control? What has racialization meant for those being racialized? Centralizing the work of Black and Indigenous thinkers, our goal will be to interrogate what race has meant in American culture over time. We will read a selection of excerpts and short texts from the 18th and 19th centuries to learn about the development of \"race science\" as a logic underpinning violently imposed social hierarchies. In tandem with this material, we will analyze Peele's film and two contemporary novels with historical roots: Colson Whitehead's The Nickel Boys (2019), the story of a young Black man in a \"reform school\" in 1960s Florida, and Tommy Orange's Wandering Stars (2024), which traces the experience of two Indigenous boys at the Carlisle Indian School, an institution designed to destroy Native culture.

Thinking of literary history as a set of conversations in verse across the centuries, we will consider how poets borrow from and respond to one another, experimenting with traditional forms and familiar themes to make the old new. In order to recognize and interpret this experimentation, we will first study those traditional forms, learning to read and interpret poetry. While we will be reading a range of poems in modern editions, we will be situating them in their social, historical, literary and material contexts, analyzing the ways in which these contexts shape our interpretation.

Sometimes it seems to offer a healing refuge, but sometimes it seems to threaten -- or even contradict -- human survival. Are we part of nature, or do we encounter it? Is human society as natural as the pack or pod, or a defense against \"the laws of nature\"? Both human and literary history have been defined by the stories we tell about the environment; our common future will be shaped the same way. What new forms of attention might address the destabilized ecologies on which we now know we depend? Tracking environmental writing from the ancient Greeks to the Anthropocene, this course offers a deep dive into the storied concept of \"nature\" and the rise of ecological thought and environmental literature. Philosophical reflection began by wondering whether something dystopian separates humanity from the rest of the cosmos. Longstanding ideas of a utopian \"green world\" have offered an escape from the greyness of everyday life and a corrective to the corruptions of the (so-called) \"real world.\" Meanwhile, industrial and technoscientific attempts to \"master\" the earth have scorched it instead, extinguishing countless species and toxifying land, water, air, and our bodies too - proving once and for all that we are a continuous part of the world.

In this class, we will trace the ongoing force of English literary refigurations of landed property initially tied to the largesse and power of the lord of the manor. We'll first explore the early modern country house poem, where the landed estate serves as a locus of pastoral abundance and naturalized social, architectural, and ecological order. But as we will discover, cracks appear in this vision. Moving forward, we encounter the idealized country house contested from the vantage of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century novels whose narrators and protagonists include servants, colonial subjects, and witnesses to family decadence financed by slavery. We'll turn to twentieth-century texts that claim the decaying country house as source of ghostly national nostalgia. Our final unit will engage public revision (in print, monuments, and activism) of the estate as \"English Heritage.\" We will watch at least one episode of Bridgerton (Season 1, 2020) and the film Saltburn (2023) to assess recent popular re-representations of the landed estate."],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be based on three short essays and one group presentation.

The course will explore Shakespeare's troubled sense that humankind, alone among all creaturely kinds, does not quite \"belong\" to nature. We'll assess how his understanding of \"Nature\" and our relation to it changes over time and how it varies in the distinct ecologies of tragedy and comedy. The critical concept of Shakespearean \"green worlds\" first arose to describe the retreats into nature (and away from civilized society) that typically occur in the comedies. In Shakespearean comedy, a removal to the green world (getting ourselves \"back to Nature\") counteracts one or another social ill, which in turn enables a rebalanced, healthier socio-political life to be restored. But how does this traditional and sometimes pastoral sense of a natural equilibrium hold up in a closer reading of the plays, especially if we consider comedies and tragedies together? Against what, exactly, is the human social order defined and established, and from what threatening \"laws of nature\" is it supposed to defend us? How does our grasp of more contemporary human impacts on the environment illuminate Shakespeare's premodern vision of human existence as a calamity of exposure - to both hard weather and our own worst instincts?

Most of us continue to experience the aftermath of the pandemic in various ways.* Primary and secondary school students continue to lag behind grade level by as much as nine months; commercial zones in major urban areas remain empty as remote working arrangements persist; millions of families grieve for lives lost to the novel coronavirus; and millions more contend with the effects of long COVID. In short, even as the epidemiological threat of the SARS-COV-2 virus has waned, the sociocultural impact of this worldwide crisis has just begun to come into focus. Having spent three years in involuntary training as amateur epidemiologists, we can now turn to the humanistic disciplines—which analyze the processes and products of human culture—to take stock of what this experience has meant for our values, our outlook, our relationships, and our culture. In that spirit, this course will investigate plague literature over the longue durée—nearly seven centuries, from 1348 C.E.-2023 C.E.—to explore the diversity of human experience in relation to plague and pestilence as represented in the Western/Anglophone canon.** Guiding questions will include: how have different groups of people searched for answers about the mechanisms and the meanings of plague (in medicine, in religion, in moral philosophy)? how have cultures responded to death rates so high that they defy traditional rituals of mourning and memorialization? what underlying prejudices, suspicions, and other social ills tend to be activated by pandemics, and to what effect? what role does literature play in helping us to formulate, and sometimes to answer, these questions and others? Course readings are divided into three units: medieval and early modern Europe, from Boccaccio to Daniel Dafoe; literature of the U.S. AIDS epidemic, including Tony Kushner and Sapphire; and a final unit on contemporary literature, featuring presentiments of and responses to COVID-19 from Ling Ma, Carmen María Machado, and Michael Cunningham. Assignments will include collective annotations on Canvas, podcast episodes (produced in small groups), Canvas Discussions, and a final essay or creative project. *As well as other crises—political, financial, moral, ethical, educational, racial, economic, and so on—but there are only ten weeks in the quarter. **The primary sources for this course were almost all composed in English; those originally composed in another language have been translated so widely as to occupy space in the Anglophone canon despite their origins in another linguistic tradition."],["Class Materials (Required)","Eula Biss.

Along the way we may ask: What do the comedic conventions of Western classical drama, the medieval genre of \"romance,\" or the political aesthetics of Romanticism have to do with the romantic comedy as it exists today? The anarchic space of the \"comedy\" genre is often understood to house a subversive potential, using absurdism or satire to scramble power dynamics or to question social norms governing gender, sexuality, race, and family. One standout question for us will be: Does the romantic comedy threaten to tame the comedy genre's subversive potential? Or does it promise to release its chaotic energies in ever renewed ways? Why do some literary forms and characters seem endlessly adaptable for different social subjects; and how does a screen actor's \"star text\" or public image help direct the genre's history?

In this seminar, we will explore some of the fundamental questions about the relationship between games and human culture. Why do people play games? What kinds of meanings, cultural values and political agendas do games encode? Do games function differently than other cultural objects, such as films, novels or works of art? What might it mean to think of all culture and works of art as arising from a \"play impulse\"? And if this is the case, why do we trivialize game-playing? Is the ubiquity of games in our lives a specifically modern phenomenon? Is the advent of the digital age producing a gamification of everyday life?

We'll assess how his understanding of \"Nature\" and our relation to it changes over his career and also how it varies in the distinct ecologies of tragedy and comedy.

There, a removal to the \"green world\" serves to counteract one or another social ill, which in turn enables a rebalanced, healthier socio-political life to be restored. But how does this traditional and sometimes pastoral sense of a natural equilibrium hold up against a closer reading of the plays, especially if we consider comedies and tragedies together? Against what, exactly, is the human order of civil life defined and established, and from what threatening \"laws of nature\" is it supposed to defend us? How does our grasp of more contemporary human impacts on the environment illuminate Shakespeare's premodern vision of human existence as a calamity of exposure -- to hard weather and our own worst instincts, too?

To understand how Native nations continuously work within and resist colonial settler systems to exercise their sovereignty, students will examine notable federal and state policies that affect Native health, wellbeing, and (lack of) access to meaningful care."],["Class Materials (Required)","All required materials will be available on Canvas."]],"o":"3","f":"3"}]},{"i":"024887","c":"WCAS","t":"Hazard, Disaster and Society","u":"GBL_HLTH","n":"337-0","s":[{"i":"024887-1","r":[{"n":"Elham Hoominfar"}],"t":"Hazard, Disaster and Society","u":"GBL_HLTH","n":"337-0","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 106"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","This course examines how socioeconomic and environmental factors work together to cause hazards and disasters in human society. In this course we learn the main concepts about disaster such as preparedness, vulnerability, resilience, response, mitigation, etc. We learn that a disaster does not have the same effect on everyone (all groups of people), and factors of social inequality such as race, ethnicity, class, and gender, make people more vulnerable to impacts of disasters. Also, this course, with an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzes disasters in the global North and South. This is a discussion-intensive course for advanced undergrad students.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, global health security, global health governance, and global health diplomacy have emerged as key issues in understanding geopolitics. How do power dynamics shape the global health landscape? Who are the various actors (state and non-state; public and private) involved in global health decisions and how do they wield power to shape policy? How do these tactics combat or reinforce health disparities? What factors make collective action and cooperation around global health issues more likely? Throughout the course we investigate how state and local governments are inﬂuenced through top-down approaches from international institutions and bottom-up approaches from grass-roots organizations. In addition to a focus on understanding how actors and processes engage in agenda setting and inﬂuence policymaking, we will discuss how enacted policies and political events impact health services delivery and population health. Students will explore these dynamics through case studies such as vaccination campaigns, abortion access, noncommunicable disease management, HIV/AIDS, TB, and climate-driven health crises, among others. Ultimately, we examine the ways in which states navigate the tension between sovereignty and cooperation when striving for global health security in an increasingly inter-connected world."],["Class Materials (Required)","All readings are available on Canvas or online through the Northwestern Library system.

Every culture produces artworks embodying the ambivalence specific to their historical moment or even concerning broader existential anxieties. Marvelous and monstrous beings can represent acute cultural anxieties or imaginaries, such as social fears about change through secularization, modernization, and changing understandings of markers of modern identity such as gender, sexuality, race, and species or life-forms. Further, what do these fascinating figures reveal about the self, which is often perceived in relation to others and individual conflicting desires? Why do we continue to produce expressions of socio-political, psychological and historical ambiguity through representations of life forms perceived to be marvelous or monstrous?

Based on readings from feminist and queer theory, urban geography, sociology, art history, literature, and social history, we will use these various perspectives to study our main laboratory: the massive urban renewal projects under Baron Haussmann during the Second Empire of Napoleon III that demolished the twisted winding streets of old Paris to build a modern capital city of commerce and leisure. Using three of Emile Zola's novels on the \"Haussmannization\" of Paris, we will examine how changes in the physical structure altered the old connections between illicit sexualities and nonconforming gender practices. We will investigate how the new department stores, apartment buildings, the café-concerts, open-air promenades, and parks promoted bourgeois gender norms and sexual identities. In turn, we will ask how, with its new opportunities and deep losses, the moral economy of capitalism (its logic of production, profit taking, and social transactions) encouraged new subjectivities that ultimately reshaped both public and intimate spaces, as well as notions of pleasure and criminality.

As substances of taste, addiction, and sociality, they are also implicated in the process of negotiating, contesting, enacting, and debating identities, belonging, gender, class, and ideas about wellness and illness.

All the topics in this course are designed to answer this question, especially with reference to how the use of drugs and alcohol intersects with everyday lives. For example, the contestation and control over who has the right or privilege to consume which drug or alcohol are tied to the issue of power, identity, and anxieties about social order.

Yet like most things so ubiquitous, war has often gone unnoticed. Once up close and visceral, American wars have grown distant and ill-defined over time. This was especially true on college campuses like ours, which have not sent large numbers of students, faculty, or alumni to war in many generations. As military veterans passed from the scene, military history disappeared from college curriculums, leaving students with little real awareness of this defining feature of the American past and present. This new lecture course aims to change that. Combining chronological coverage with topical concerns about race, gender, citizenship, and politics, it views the United States, its peoples, and its place in the world through the prism of war. As it goes it educates students in college-level historical reading, thinking, writing, and verbal expression.

At the course's foundation lies a hypothesis: the practice of imprisoning masses of people for extended periods of time is both a product of the modern state and a constituent element of the modern era. Every modern state has its own prison system to remove those it deems criminal from society. Over the past two centuries numerous regimes have resorted to detention camps in one form or another: to confine allegedly rebellious peoples, feared minorities, enemy soldiers, or stateless refugees. With varying degrees of brutality and murderous intent - a critical consideration the course will always keep in mind - those in power have used prisons and camps to suppress racial, religious, political, and other identified groups, and to exploit their labor for public and private use. Authorities have mandated that the condemned toil in confinement to pay a debt to society and for their own rehabilitation. Regardless of the great variety of pretexts under which regimes have imprisoned citizens and subjects, both modern structures of incarceration and the experience of the incarcerated bear a great number of similarities that this course will explore and discuss. The course begins with a consideration of alternate forms of punishment common to the premodern era and then follows the development and spread of the modern prison and the proliferation of mass detention camps across the globe over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will seek to understand the prisoner experience (to the extent possible) and discuss the place of bounded sites of detention in governance, justice, repression, societal relations, and, ultimately, tourism."],["Learning Objectives","The course introduces students to the intertwined histories of the modern prison and various types of detention camps (concentration, reeducation, forced labor, refugee) that became ubiquitous over the course of the modern era. With an eye to both similarity and difference, the course aims to investigate these developments from an integrated global perspective in an effort to understand the ideas behind the implementation of specific systems of confinement and the lived experience of those confined. Students will read a variety of sources, including primary witness accounts, and employ them in class discussions and written assignments to craft original historical arguments."],["Evaluation Method","Discussion section participation (20%), Weekly Journal Entries (10%), Paper (5-7pp.:30%), Final Exam/Paper/Project (40%)"],["Class Materials (Required)","Materials will be posted on Canvas"],["Class Notes","Concentration: Global"]],"o":"45","f":"54"},{"i":"025036-60","t":"A Global History of Prisons and Camps","u":"HISTORY","n":"253-0","s":"60","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 3322"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"45","f":"54"},{"i":"025036-61","t":"A Global History of Prisons and Camps","u":"HISTORY","n":"253-0","s":"61","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 4670"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"45","f":"54"},{"i":"025036-62","t":"A Global History of Prisons and Camps","u":"HISTORY","n":"253-0","s":"62","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 218"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"45","f":"54"},{"i":"025036-63","t":"A Global History of Prisons and Camps","u":"HISTORY","n":"253-0","s":"63","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"45","f":"54"},{"i":"025036-64","t":"A Global History of Prisons and Camps","u":"HISTORY","n":"253-0","s":"64","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 4722"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"45","f":"54"},{"i":"025036-65","t":"A Global History of Prisons and Camps","u":"HISTORY","n":"253-0","s":"65","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-339"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"45","f":"54"}]},{"i":"002037","c":"WCAS","t":"Modern Africa","u":"HISTORY","n":"255-3","s":[{"i":"002037-61","t":"Modern Africa","u":"HISTORY","n":"255-3","s":"61","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L05"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"002037-62","t":"Modern Africa","u":"HISTORY","n":"255-3","s":"62","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L05"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"002037-X60","t":"Modern Africa","u":"HISTORY","n":"255-3","s":"X60","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["NO DATA"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"002037-20","r":[{"n":"Sean Allen Hanretta","a":"Harris Hall 310"}],"t":"Modern Africa","u":"HISTORY","n":"255-3","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 121"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":30,"p":[["Overview of class","African history from the mid-1800s to 2000.

Based on readings from feminist and queer theory, urban geography, sociology, art history, literature, and social history, we will use these various perspectives to study our main laboratory: the massive urban renewal projects under Baron Haussmann during the Second Empire of Napoleon III that demolished the twisted winding streets of old Paris to build a modern capital city of commerce and leisure. Using three of Emile Zola's novels on the \"Haussmannization\" of Paris, we will examine how changes in the physical structure altered the old connections between illicit sexualities and nonconforming gender practices. We will investigate how the new department stores, apartment buildings, the café-concerts, open-air promenades, and parks promoted bourgeois gender norms and sexual identities. In turn, we will ask how, with its new opportunities and deep losses, the moral economy of capitalism (its logic of production, profit taking, and social transactions) encouraged new subjectivities that ultimately reshaped both public and intimate spaces, as well as notions of pleasure and criminality.

But beyond all the glitz and romance, the period from about 1500-1800 was also one of significant transformations in the social, cultural, and political life of the Indian subcontinent. This course will survey some of these developments, begininning with the integration of India's multiple religious, literary, and visual cultures under the Mughal Empire's ideology of \"universal civility\" (sulh-i kull). This policy included the welcoming of European merchants and missionaries who began arriving in the Indian subcontinent during the 16th century; but as Mughal power waned in the 18th century, it faced challenges not only from former client states and regional kingdoms that sought to fill its shoes, but also from the encounter with Europe, particularly the growing military and economic might of the British. And as the British role in India transitioned from one of mere traders to that of empire-builders with a so-called \"civilizing mission,\" they too would transform the culture and society of India in ways that continue to resonate in South Asian history and cultural memory today."],["Learning Objectives","The readings in this course draw from a range of genres: primary sources, scholarly articles, and a general textbook (see below) that synthesizes a dazzling array of recent scholarship on early modern India.

Travelers, scholars, seafarers, nationalists, political organizers, and religious leaders who resided along the shores of Asia's \"Water Frontier\" perceived that they lived in an interconnected world that was not bound by national borders. There is a large literature on the \"Global South,\" but little attention has been paid to the \"Asian South\" as a category of historical analysis. In this seminar, we will begin to conceptualize the Asian South as a \"middle ground\" of expanding colonial frontiers (including the Chinese and Japanese frontiers) and emerging nation-states as well as a maritime economy that was integral to the emergence of the modern world.

It will afford students the opportunity to engage with major questions that arise in teaching history, and to develop skills that they can apply later in their graduate careers or on the academic job market. Particular attention will be paid to designing syllabi whose contents serve the intended pedagogical purposes and performing the tasks of lecturing and leading seminars. Compared to other graduate seminars, this course will not be onerous: it meets only every two weeks (except at the beginning of the quarter, when we meet twice in a row on week 2 and week 3), and reading assignments are relatively short.

The final project is a short video about your case study. To develop your research projects, the class foregrounds different methodological approaches: 1) To move beyond journalism, we will conduct primary and secondary historical research to understand the complex historical roots of each case study. 2) We will analyze and practice forms of ethnographic writing to better situate and describe the lived experiences of migration and exile, both past and present. 3) We will pay attention to various forms of media, whether print culture, sound, or visual media, to interrogate but also experiment with contemporary modes of narrating and conveying human experience in the digital age. Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated.

We routinely ingest, for example, infographics about demographic trends, media coverage on crime and undocumented immigration, and advertisements for ancestry tests. In complex and contextually specific ways, this diet shapes our personal and collective identities, social interactions and relationships, and political aspirations and anxieties. In this course, we endeavor to study the politics of racial knowledge—the ways in which categories, measurements, and other techniques of knowledge production have helped to constitute \"race\" as a seemingly objective, natural demarcation among human populations and institute forms of racial domination and inequality. Historically, racial knowledge has stipulated and legitimated what we might describe as a kind of racial ontology, a set of assumptions, claims, and prescriptions about race and racial superiority/inferiority—e.g., the notion that \"whites\" or \"the West\" represent the apex of human civilization. Drawing on diverse texts, this course explores of the emergence, evolution, and effects of racial knowledge. This exploration will begin by discussing the historical relationship between the modern concept of race and European colonialism and slavery. Subsequently, we will track several major developments in the history of racial knowledge, from Enlightenment naturalists to censuses to contemporary genomics research."],["Learning Objectives","At the end of this class, students should be able to describe how have diverse actors—e.g., scientists, state officials, and coders—have made and mobilized racial knowledge.

In this process, the elements that comprise our environment—earth, water, air, minerals, trash & treasures—will transform from scenery to agentic forces with whom living beings act. As we move through this pilgrimage across disciplines, we will ask ourselves: What are the consequences of understanding ourselves as individual agents, acting alone in the universe? In what ways is individualism a sought-after virtue according to some, and part and parcel of humans' earth destroying tendencies according to others? What alternative ways of being and knowing can we imagine that present human agency in relational terms, co-constituted not just by other organisms, but also by a web of environmental conditions that make life possible?

It combines analysis of big data with simple mathematical modeling to capture the essence of collective behaviors. Systems biology is a gateway to synthetic biology, which engineers novel living systems based on collective behaviors.

The final project is a short video about your case study. To develop your research projects, the class foregrounds different methodological approaches: 1) To move beyond journalism, we will conduct primary and secondary historical research to understand the complex historical roots of each case study. 2) We will analyze and practice forms of ethnographic writing to better situate and describe the lived experiences of migration and exile, both past and present. 3) We will pay attention to various forms of media, whether print culture, sound, or visual media, to interrogate but also experiment with contemporary modes of narrating and conveying human experience in the digital age. Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated. You do not need to have prior research experience, but you need to demonstrate a desire to dig into your topic and hone your ability to write deeply informed, rigorous, and nuanced arguments and to think about creative ways to bring rigorous historical and ethnographic detail to visual storytelling."],["Class Materials (Required)","All materials will be on Canvas."]],"o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"016391","c":"WCAS","t":"Integrating Project Seminar","u":"INTL_ST","n":"395-0","s":[{"i":"016391-20","r":[{"n":"Jennifer Lin"}],"t":"Integrating Project Seminar","k":"Civil Military Relations in Democratic Societies","u":"INTL_ST","n":"395-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute M166"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"SEM","a":6,"p":[["Overview of class","Civil Military Relations in Democratic Societies Democracies around the world require a military to defend their people, values and interests from enemies abroad and within. They require a military to help advance the national interest abroad. However, they also need a military that will not seek to undermine the freedoms and will of the people that make democratic governance possible. In other words, the military must be subordinate to elected leaders and not seek to build a coup. Civil-Military Relations describes the connections that civilian policymakers have with their country's armed forces. It is the boundaries between diplomacy and war. Civilians and their elected leaders should focus on making foreign policy while the military should focus on how to best defend the state. When in good balance, proper relations sustain a democracy as the will of the people, reflected through their elected leaders, prevail. When in poor balance, military leaders can overtake the government in the form of a coup. In this course, we will think about the role of a military in a democratic government and how democracies use their militaries to advance their interests abroad. In addition, we will think about how civilian leaders and military officers ought to interact with one another to sustain a democracy. Finally, students will apply the current theories and debates in civil-military relations to develop a research project of personal interest. By the end of the course, students will be able to contribute to discussions in the literature through asking and answering questions of their own. They will also be able to become critical consumers of academic literature and be able to communicate their findings to a general audience."]]},{"i":"016391-21","r":[{"n":"Dinara Urazova"}],"t":"Integrating Project Seminar","k":"Power and Media in a Mutlipolar World","u":"INTL_ST","n":"395-0","s":"21","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G28"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"SEM","a":6,"p":[["Overview of class","Power and Media in a Mutlipolar World This course will introduce students to various theories, concepts, and approaches to studying the connection between developments in media/technologies and political processes.

Our geographic scope is global, given the worldwide reach of these technologies. We will examine how various regimes differ in their adoption and utilization of these technologies, how a variety of new actors arise on the political scene to challenge existing regimes, and how actors fail or succeed in their usage and incorporation of media/technologies. Among the key issues we will explore is the power to influence perception, the power to influence emotions, and the power to control narratives. We will see how thinkers and scholars understand these issues from a variety of perspectives, both old and new."]]}]},{"i":"017518","c":"WCAS","t":"Honors Seminar","u":"INTL_ST","n":"398-2","s":[{"i":"017518-1","r":[{"n":"J Michelle Molina","p":"847 4612620","a":"Crowe Hall, 4-142"}],"t":"Honors Seminar","u":"INTL_ST","n":"398-2","s":"1","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"l":["INTL_ST Sem Rm 201 - 2010 Sh"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"THE","a":10}]},{"i":"018907","c":"WCAS","t":"Climate Change and Sustainability: Ethical Dimensions","u":"ISEN","n":"230-0","s":[{"i":"018907-20","r":[{"n":"Lendell Chad Horne"}],"t":"Climate Change and Sustainability: Ethical Dimensions","u":"ISEN","n":"230-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G15"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":80,"p":[["NO DATA","NO DATA"]],"o":"5","f":"5"}]},{"i":"018835","c":"WCAS","t":"NUvention: Energy","u":"ISEN","n":"420-0","s":[{"i":"018835-20","r":[{"n":"Mark W Werwath"},{"n":"Ian Zachary Hoopes Wiese"}],"t":"NUvention: Energy","u":"ISEN","n":"420-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Ford ITW Auditorium 1350"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":30}]},{"i":"021075","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","u":"ISEN","n":"495-0","s":[{"i":"021075-20","r":[{"n":"Manohar Ramchandra Kulkarni","p":"847/467-6741","a":"Technological Institute, Rm B290, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS"}],"t":"Special Topics in Energy and Sustainability","k":"Industrl Energy Mgmt & Utiliz","u":"ISEN","n":"495-0","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute M128"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":15}]},{"i":"003078","c":"WCAS","t":"Elementary Italian","u":"ITALIAN","n":"101-1","s":[{"i":"003078-20","r":[{"n":"Daniele Biffanti"}],"t":"Elementary Italian","u":"ITALIAN","n":"101-1","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 4-410"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","A beginning course in Italian language and culture, Elementary Italian is devoted to developing all four language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) within the three modes of communication (interpersonal, interpretive, presentational).

Our work in class will be collaborative, thus a key prerequisite is that you are mature and self-motivated. You do not need to have prior research experience, but you need to demonstrate a desire to dig into your topic and hone your ability to write deeply informed, rigorous, and nuanced arguments and to think about creative ways to bring rigorous historical and ethnographic detail to visual storytelling."],["Class Materials (Required)","All materials will be on Canvas."]],"o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"018910","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in Latin American and Caribbean Studies","u":"LATIN_AM","n":"401-0","s":[{"i":"018910-1","r":[{"n":"Adriana V Coronel Valencia"}],"t":"Special Topics in Latin American and Caribbean Studies","k":"Crisis, Contentious Politics, and Critical Thought","u":"LATIN_AM","n":"401-0","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Fisk Hall 114"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"SEM","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","Crisis, Contentious Politics, and Critical Thought in Latin America The course starts with a critique of theories that, in the second half of the 20th century, argued for the impossibility of a democratic matrix of modernity in Latin America. Instead, it seeks to highlight how the continent served as a laboratory in which, during various cycles of global crisis, attempts were made to consolidate a democratic path, specifically one that addressed popular sovereignty as the expansion of the political sphere, redistribution, and cultural representation. The course explores cycles of capitalism that have put different social classes under tension, the politicization of these differences, the formation of power dynamics, the configuration of state institutions and the shared repertoires between state agencies and social subjects. In connection, the course addresses the contest over the interpretation of social tensions as shaped by ideology, culture, and aesthetic representation. The debates accompanying the periods to be addressed include: the Spanish American Enlightenment, imperialism, and democratic republicanism (Black and popular); racial positivism and revolutionary modernism; gamonal and falangist thought versus national-popular thought and the strategy of popular fronts in Latin America; avant-gardes in the context of the struggle for hegemony; the Cold War, the origins of postmodernism; dependency theories and the Marxist school of modes of production theory in Latin America. The debate over the origins of the welfare state or pre-emptive state in Latin America, the problem of the national-popular in the face of the 20th-century crisis will also be addressed. The course will end with a discussion of Ideologies and violence surrounding authoritarian neoliberalism and the problem of hegemony in the present. This course combines social history of politics and political languages, critical studies on culture and hegemony, and historical and comparative sociology from Latin America."]]}]},{"i":"024851","c":"WCAS","t":"First-Year Writing Seminar","u":"LEGAL_ST","n":"101-8","s":[{"i":"024851-1","r":[{"n":"Shana B Bernstein","p":"847/467-6850","a":"620 Lincoln #205","b":"Dr. Bernstein received her Ph.D. in U.S. History from Stanford University.

With only a pencil and paper, we can predict when a falling object will land, compute the likelihood of a royal flush in poker, and discover facts like the Pythagorean Theorem that never become outdated. We talk about objects like \"numbers\" and \"functions\" that cannot be seen, heard, or felt, and yet are essential to our understanding of the natural world. The concept of infinity becomes, rather than an object of mystical wonderment, a tool for doing calculus. How is any of this possible? In this course, we will discuss the relationship between mathematics, knowledge, and nature. We will ask questions like \"What is a number, really?\" and \"Can we know infinitely many things?\" We will read a wide variety of texts, from Plato's \"Meno\" to Wigner's \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.\" These topics will be the whetstone on which we hone our skills of technical writing, persuasive writing, and even creative writing. It is not necessary to have any background in college-level mathematics in order to engage with these topics; this course has no math courses as prerequisites.

What political claims do people make related to their genetic and cultural descent? This course examines these questions by looking into historical, social, and legal processes in which ancestries are curated.

At its height, their empire extended from Hungary to Korea, and from Siberia to Burma. This course introduces students to the empire's history - from the Mongols' harsh living conditions as nomads in the Mongolian Steppe to Chinggis Khan's rise to power and extraordinary military success, which facilitated the Mongol Empire's near universal expansion. We will explore how the Mongols ruled over diverse geographical regions and populations, and the impact their expansion had on the territories they ruled and further beyond. We will read sources in translation and discuss how European, Chinese, Arabic and Persian authors viewed the Mongols, but also what we can learn from the Secret History of the Mongols, the Mongols' account of the establishment of their empire. In the past few decades, the image of the Mongols in modern scholarship has changed: no longer only brutal yet highly effective nomadic conquerors, they are recognized also as cultural agents responsible for fostering cross-cultural encounters and facilitating inter-Eurasian exchanges of knowledge and expertise, from warfare to astronomy and medicine. We will explore the results of the transmission and mobility of people, objects, technologies, and ideas between China, the Middle East, and Europe during this era."]],"o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"020941-60","t":"Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies","k":"Arabian Peninsula Since 18th Century","u":"MENA","n":"390-4","s":"60","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["NO DATA"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"020941-61","t":"Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies","k":"Arabian Peninsula Since 18th Century","u":"MENA","n":"390-4","s":"61","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["NO DATA"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"020941-62","t":"Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies","k":"Arabian Peninsula Since 18th Century","u":"MENA","n":"390-4","s":"62","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["NO DATA"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"020942","c":"WCAS","t":"Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies","u":"MENA","n":"390-6","s":[{"i":"020942-1","r":[{"n":"Rebecca Carol Johnson","p":"847/467-1365","a":"University Hall 225"}],"t":"Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies","k":"Postcolonial Noir","u":"MENA","n":"390-6","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-331"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"SEM","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","Postcolonial Noir Crime fiction is where questions of law, justice, and community are investigated, but only rarely resolved. This course will explore this problem in a transnational context, to expose the fundamental issues of power and difference that have underlain the classic detective novel, with emphasis on empire and colonialism.

We will be guided by nested \"what does it take\"-questions. For example: What does it take for natural science to be -in societies with a scientific culture—the legitimate authority on matters of fact about nature? What does it take for a system of assertions to count as a good scientific theory? What does it take for a scientific theory to be testable by evidence like observational and experimental data (and: what does it take for certain series of experiences to count as data, observations, experimental results?)? What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors? What does it take for a given theory to explain the known phenomena in an area of knowledge? What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality? We will begin with a brief overview of the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 th century, and then turn to contemporary discussions on the problem of induction, the problem of the underdetermination of theory choice by the available data, the problem of rationality, the problem of realism. This will include reflecting on reasons philosophers of science have established against some common preconceptions about what it takes to be entitled to scientific objectivity, such as that science provides ‘proof', or that there is one simple, context-free ‘scientific method', or that scientific objectivity is free of considerations of values or informed judgment. Many contemporary doubt-manufacturers selectively use parts of such reasons to suggest the skeptical attitude that science produces just one among many optional beliefs about reality, and that others (like religion, or what serves the oil industry) are equally valid. Against this, we will see that the reasons against proof as the standard (and in favor of evidential support and fallibility) in fact don't weaken but instead strengthen the justifications of why we ought to trust scientifically formed belief where it and its institutional and social conditions are available more than any other (purported) sources of information on nature."],["Learning Objectives","Having worked through the materials offered, students will... -be competent in the major paradigms and revolutions behind contemporary natural science -be able to identify, discuss and appreciate foundations of advanced scientific theories that use vocabulary referring to entities not observable by the human perceptual equipment -be able to conduct a formally correct argument articulating methodological and/or ontological and/or evaluative aspects of scientific work -Have gained an appreciation of the deep reach of human factors in scientific practice (like background understandings, relevance constraints, comparative judgments) of even the natural sciences, and thereby have acquired a sophisticated concept of scientific objectivity."],["Evaluation Method","•\tClass and Section participation will be decisive in case of doubt, and can influence your grade up to 20%.\n•\tOne short paper (Midterm) should be ~1200 words long.

In fact, over the past decades most countries in the world have ratified at least some of the core human rights conventions and treaties. Although human rights have become the lingua franca of international political discourse, there is still a lot of disagreement on what human rights are as well as on what human rights there are. Moreover, on the wake of globalization, it is becoming increasingly difficult to answer the question of who has which human rights obligations towards whom. The traditional answer that only states have human rights obligations towards their own populations is becoming less and less plausible in light of the impact that actions of global economic institutions or transnational corporations have on the ability of states to protect human rights. These difficulties fuel recent criticisms of the human rights project that portray it as either insufficiently ambitious for achieving global justice or even as directly complicit in the perpetuation of injustices. With these problems in view, we will examine the main philosophical approaches to human rights currently under discussion to assess the plausibility of the answers they provide to these difficult normative questions."],["Learning Objectives","The goals of the seminar are (1) to analyze the different contemporary conceptions of human rights, (2) to explore the conceptual tools that they provide for answering the challenges that globalization poses to human rights practice, and (3) to deepen the students' understanding of contemporary debates in political philosophy while enhancing their oral debate and writing skills."],["Class Materials (Required)","All class materials will be available on Canvas at NO cost to the student.

That representation is built out of the meanings of the individual words in a sentence. So when a declarative is sentence is used by a speaker, a proposition is communicated. However, in many contexts, additional propositions are communicated by a speaker's use of a sentence. These propositions go beyond the sentence's meaning, and are the result of a hearer drawing inferences based on what the speaker said in conjunction with other considerations. These are pragmatic inferences. This class is about how they are derived, what distinguishes them, and how to explain them. We will consider inferences derived with considerations about the speaker's cooperativity (implicatures), inferences derived with facts about the broader structure of the discourse (elicitures), inferences derived from world knowledge that seem to enrich a sentence's meaning (implicitures), and more. Depending on interest, we will also consider pragmatic inferences in connection with topics like deception, narrative, and testimony."],["Class Materials (Required)","All class materials will be available on Canvas at NO cost to the student."]]}]},{"i":"002656","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in Ancient Philosophy","u":"PHIL","n":"420-0","s":[{"i":"002656-20","r":[{"n":"Claudia Yau"}],"t":"Studies in Ancient Philosophy","u":"PHIL","n":"420-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge 3438 Philosophy Sem.

How can special relativity which allows space and time to rotate into each other be consistent with the quantum mechanics of Bohr, Planck, Heisenberg, and Schrodinger which as we learn treats time on a very special footing?

Symmetry groups (2-D rotations, 3-D rotations, Lorentz transformations). Special relativity and relativistic notation. Energy and momentum of a point particle.

Maxwell's equations, conservation laws and the Poynting vector, Scalar and vector potentials and their E&M gauge transformations.

Lorentz transformations and invariants of the current and fields. The stress-energy tensor. The relativistic point particle. Part 3: Action principles. The electromagnetic field interacting with a point particle. Conservation laws from symmetry via Noether. Part 4: Solving the wave equations using Green's functions. The Green's function in relativistic form. Relativistic particle moving in an arbitrary manner. The Lienard-Wiechert potentials. Part 6: Linear acceleration and synchrotron radiation.

The course will focus substantively on the use of state violence and civil penalties in contexts of war, families, and corporations, including the university.

The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A.

Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries in the world rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national. The course is organized thematically. We start with an introduction to the study of International Political Economy (IPE) and explore why it is distinct from international economics; following the introduction to the course we will discuss the problem of international cooperation when national economic policies have spillover effects. The next three topics (weeks 2-6) are devoted to three of the main issue areas that concern IPE specialists: the politics of the international trade, monetary, and financial systems. We then turn our attention to economic development strategies pursued by low- and middle-income countries and the role of foreign development aid in promoting growth. The last two weeks of the course are devoted to the relationship between transnational economic linkages and conflict and to the rise of new economic powerhouses (namely, China) and the possible consequences of this shift for American influence in global economic affairs."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of this course students will Deepen their understanding of the historical and political foundations of international markets for trade in goods and services, foreign investment, money, and financial assets.

Work alongside colleagues to master the granular details and big-picture takeaways from a set of complex, challenging cases - each of which are connected to key themes in the field of international political economy.

Throughout the course we attend to the intersections of race with other identities such as ethnic/national origin, nativity, citizenship status, legal status, class, age, gender, sexuality, and religion."]]},{"i":"002820-25","r":[{"n":"Andrew L Roberts","a":"Scott, #205","o":"http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/advising.html"}],"t":"Political Research Seminar","k":"How to Fix U.S Politics","u":"POLI_SCI","n":"395-0","s":"25","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Scott Hall 212"],"d":"2025-01-06","e":"2025-03-15","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Political Science students who are Juniors or Seniors","p":[["Overview of class","This class will consider ways to improve American politics.

Why does inequality so fundamentally shape our social reality?; why does it seem to persist against efforts to bring about equity and justice?; and how is our psychology involved in this process? This seminar is designed to accomplish two goals: (1) to provide an empirical and historical knowledge base that will help you generate your answers to these questions; and (2) to better understand how social psychologists study inequality. To accomplish these two goals, we will use readings, discussions, activities, and brief written assignments to develop our understanding of inequality, and its roots in fundamental aspects of our lives and psychology."],["Registration Requirements","Psych 205 required, Psych 204 recommended but not required"],["Learning Objectives","At the end of the course, students will have a clearer sense of:\n•\tThe reasons why inequality is interlocking and pervasive in our social systems\n•\tHow inequality shapes human potential across the life course\n•\tThe cognitive, motivational, and affective states that are shaped by inequality\n•\tHow the production of psychological science is rooted in inequalities\n•\tHow inequality defines the challenges of our past, present, and future\n•\tPsychological processes involved in solidarity, resistance, and collective action\n•\tHow researchers have studied the psychology of inequality in the past, as well as how they might study it in the future\nIn practical terms, students who complete this course will be topic experts on this subject and will be prepared to explore how inequality shapes the world and their lives with greater clarity and depth in the future."],["Teaching Method","Class will be a dynamic, mixing discussion, lecture, group work, and short writing/reflection assignments"],["Evaluation Method","25%

Even in death, however, many aspired to rebirth in heavenly realms where bodies do not grow old and die, but rather live forever in bliss.

We worry about our own individual futures (will I have a job when I graduate from Northwestern?), we worry about other peoples' futures (will my child get a job after they graduate from college?), and we worry about our collective futures (what will climate change do to our society over the next 50 years?). Frequently, we make plans for the future, either to create a future that we seek, or to avoid a future that is problematic. Public policy is often concerned with how to create better collective futures, and the tricky part is figuring out which alternatives are better than others, and for whom. Sometimes people make contingency plans, deciding what to do if something happens (for example, disaster planning). Such activity generally involves making two types of guesses: what will or could happen in the future, and what will our future preferences be about those various possibilities. In certain cases, the predictions we make are \"self-fulfilling\" in that the prediction helps to make itself come true (bank runs are a classic example). In this course, we will work through a series of examples where people have thought about the future, sometimes focused on its very specific features.

In this course, we endeavor to study the politics of racial knowledge—the ways in which categories, measurements, and other techniques of knowledge production have helped to constitute \"race\" as a seemingly objective, natural demarcation among human populations and institute forms of racial domination and inequality. Historically, racial knowledge has stipulated and legitimated what we might describe as a kind of racial ontology, a set of assumptions, claims, and prescriptions about race and racial superiority/inferiority—e.g. the notion that \"whites\" or \"the West\" represent the apex of human civilization. Drawing on diverse texts, this course explores of the emergence, evolution, and effects of racial knowledge.

Gender is conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, always constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We will analyze the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? And how has anti-feminism come to be a significant dimension of politics? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to modern women's movements. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. We examine some of the gendered aspects of the political landscape in the contemporary United States, with class input on which issues to explore.

In addition to considering different theoretical traditions, students will also consider issues such as trustworthiness and the use of negative or deviant cases. • The practice of qualitative inquiry. Students will explore sampling strategies; instrument and research design; observation and interview techniques; and a variety of approaches to data analysis and data presentation. • Key issues that researchers encounter in doing qualitative research. Students will consider a range of practical issues that they will have to deal with as researchers including access to sites and ethical issues relating to qualitative work.

Taking as a point of departure the essay's reflection on the first century of photography's history, and the corpus of both photographers (Atget, Renger Patzsch, Sander, Bossfeldt, Freund, Krull, Abbott) and photographer's historians it gathers, we explore both the critical vocabulary Benjamin develops around them as well its conceptual apparatus. We closely analyze the photobooks Benjamin reviews in his essay as well as the photobook phenomenon in interwar years globally. Then we move to a secondary bibliography that produced significant interpretations of Benjamin's essay: Cadava, Silverman, Didi-Hubermann, Collingwood-Selby, Zervigón, and finally we assess its oblique influence in Barthes' Camera Lucida."],["Registration Requirements","Permission number when not registering as CLS or Spanish grad student."],["Learning Objectives","- Students will develop theoretical expertise on the photographic medium reading from diverse disciplines, philosophy, literature, cultural studies, historical studies.\n- Students will be familiar with an historical overview of the development of photography as a visual medium as well as cultural phemomena\n- Students will develop their critical writing skills summarizing, confronting and evaluating theoretical arguments. - Students will develop their creative and interpretive writing, elaborating their own critical close readings of visual materials."],["Class Materials (Required)","All required readings will be uploaded in the Canvas course site.
