Companies need to engage and persuade employees to be brand ambassadors with customers, the community where they work and among fellow employees. A key part of reaching employees results from effective leadership communications using trusted leaders. The world has changed over the past few years, making the task of aligning, engaging and motivating employees even harder. Today's workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over. Reaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what's important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there's a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty. Beyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations. Often, employees want to participate because they know maintaining healthy communities helps them keep social structures functioning well. Millennials and Gen Z entering the workforce are looking for companies, which have strong social responsibility commitments and offer ways for employees to participate.\""]]}]},{"i":"024322","c":"JOUR","t":"Special Topics","u":"IMC","n":"591-0","s":[{"i":"024322-22","r":[{"n":"Danielle Robinson Bell"},{"n":"Bradley Akubuiro"}],"t":"Special Topics","k":"Stakeholder Communications and Society","u":"IMC","n":"591-0","s":"22","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["Washington, DC Bureau"],"d":"2025-06-23","e":"2025-08-31","c":"LEC","a":30,"p":[["Overview of class","TBA"]]},{"i":"024322-40","r":[{"n":"Ryan Reis"}],"t":"Special Topics","k":"Advanced Brand Management","u":"IMC","n":"591-0","s":"40","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":0}],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2025-06-23","e":"2025-08-31","c":"LEC","a":30,"p":[["Overview of class","Advanced Brand Management is for students seeking modern marketing solutions to some of the main issues facing brand managers today.

Yet Disney's innovations in animation are best understood not on their own, but in relation to its competitors and to the demands of the media environment at the time. New animation technologies, especially, played a key role in differentiating Disney products from those of other studios. Even these innovations, however, often came on the heels of similar attempts by competitors. Indeed, Disney Studios' twin drives to mimic the successes of its rivals and to differentiate its product extended throughout its history to areas beyond animation technology, including television programming, popular music, and musical theatre, especially Broadway. This course will explore the history of Disney's animated films in relation to their industrial contexts: what conditions in the animation and entertainment industries prompted innovation in, for example, character design, voice acting, the depiction of depth, the use of live-action, the choices of song and musical structure, or the use of CGI in Disney animated films? Assessments will be based on vocabulary quizzes, written assessments, and an in-class presentation.</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li>Open to sophomore and above</li> <li>Satisfies Film and Design Minor</li>\n</ul>"]]}]},{"i":"021985","c":"DOHA","t":"Topics in Interactive Media","u":"MIT","n":"376-0","s":[{"i":"021985-70","r":[{"n":"Spencer Striker"}],"t":"Topics in Interactive Media","k":"AI Tools for Digital Media","u":"MIT","n":"376-0","s":"70","m":["012"],"x":[{"h":6,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":8,"m":30}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 1-225"],"d":"2025-05-18","e":"2025-06-26","c":"LEC","a":16,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Juniors and above who have taken MIT 190.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>AI Tools for Digital Media Design explores the integration of AI into creative domains, including design, illustration, vfx, and animation.

The hunt takes many paths: finding love, wealth, or fame; earning an education, job, or lifestyle; attaining bliss, heaven, or a fairy tale ending. This writing class explores how we have defined, pursued and, at times, attained happiness. We ask the question: \"is happiness a goal or a journey?\" We examine how the ideal of happiness finds expression in our culture through philosophy, art, literature, music, and film. We also explore social phenomena such as the quest for higher education, the explosion of the self-help industry, and the ebb and flow of our consumer culture. Writers will read a variety of sources on the pursuit of happiness and conduct their own research to reflect, shape, and argue their perspective. Writers will compose a variety of documents that will ultimately lead to a ten to twelve-page persuasive researched essay. Writers will also learn scholarly conventions that they can apply to other academic course work. The course is conducted completely online.

As such, topics for this course will include understanding organizations as complex social systems; the difference between leadership and managerial authority; navigating the politics of competing factions within organizations to achieve shared goals; how a firm-wide, national, or global event like a pandemic can jolt the very definition of leadership and further require technological advancements, organizational transformation, and proactive and reactive change; emotional intelligence and the role of building and maintaining relationships of trust to drive optimal performance and continuous improvement; and the role of leadership in creating an environment in which risk-taking and innovative solutions are encouraged, learned from, and rewarded.The class, as well as students' experiences, will serve as foundational learning and ultimately become case studies in leadership.

Through this course students will be introduced to a range of concepts, often used descriptively or not explained though familiar in popular discourse (e.g. ‘Blackness', ‘Abolition', ‘Anti-Slavery'). Throughout the course students will learn techniques for evaluating and applying concepts. Overall, the course will challenge students to think more analytically, critically and methodologically about role of critical concepts in Black studies research."]]},{"i":"001218-21","r":[{"n":"John Marquez","p":"847 491 5122","a":"1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-135"}],"t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Hip-Hop Music and Film: The Golden Age","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"21","m":["0123"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":30}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-335"],"d":"2025-07-07","e":"2025-07-20","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","Hip-Hop is an artistic genre born from distinct political-economic circumstances.

Why would someone choose to write a \"philosophical novel\" as opposed to a philosophical essay or treatise? What is it to read a text philosophically, and how might such a reading contrast with other modes of textual interpretation? In this class, we'll reflect on these questions by reading novels, plays, poetry, literary criticism, and philosophical essays. Central to our investigation are two great modernist novels: Marcel Proust's Swann's Way and Viriginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. We'll pay special attention to how questions about knowledge, the self, and intersubjectivity arise and are addressed in these texts.

Our readings will primarily consist of translated and anglophone short stories and novels as well as films and documentaries that delve into issues of embodiment, labour, kinship, desire, and queerness across diverse geographies, including colonial, modern, and contemporary South Asia, the Caribbean, and Britain. We will ask: how do we appreciate the silences and textures of \"third-world women's writing\" without reifying categories such as the \"third-world\" and \"women\" in the first place? What are the pitfalls and potentialities of thinking about a transnational or multicultural feminist politics in times of neoliberal precarity and rising authoritarianism? Can we envision a politics of sexual desire, queerness, or pleasure that undoes identitarian formations, instead of settling for a short-sighted politics of inclusivity? We will develop a critical framework for closely reading our texts by drawing from scholars in postcolonial, psychoanalytic, and queer theoretical schools such as Gayatri Spivak, Saidiya Hartman, Ranjana Khanna, Gayatri Gopinath, and Ann McClintock, among others.

While the texts we examine may not be explicitly religious, the act of reading itself will be treated as a sacred act—one of daily engagement. We will study key literary forms from the 10th to the 19th centuries, beginning with early genres like the Maqāmah (picaresque tales) and the Risālah (letters or epistles). We will then move into modern genres, which include the Riḥlā (travelogues) from the Naḥdah period, also known as the Arab Renaissance, and the early Arabic novel. As we examine these works, we will explore a central challenge: translation and interpretation. Arabic literary traditions can differ greatly from Western ones, and this contrast will be a key part of our discussions. We will look at how each genre functions within its own cultural context and identify what makes it distinctively Arabic. Throughout the course, we will consider both the formal elements (like structure and style) and thematic concerns (such as satire, love, trickery, piety, and even blasphemy). These themes appear across different genres, and by studying them, we will gain insight into how they evolve and intersect over time. Even though the genres we study might seem very different on the surface, we will also discover how they overlap, revealing the fluid and interconnected nature of Arabic literature.\nBy the end of the course, you will have a deeper understanding of adab—the term used for Arabic literary culture—and will be able to analyze the key elements of each genre, identify common themes, and appreciate the complexity and richness of Arabic literary traditions throughout history."]]}]},{"i":"001646","c":"WCAS","t":"Introduction to Macroeconomics","u":"ECON","n":"201-0","s":[{"i":"001646-25","r":[{"n":"Mark Witte"}],"t":"Introduction to Macroeconomics","u":"ECON","n":"201-0","s":"25","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":15}],"l":["Kellogg Econ Classroom 1410"],"d":"2025-06-23","e":"2025-07-27","c":"LEC","a":50,"p":[["Overview of class","An introduction to economics with an emphasis on macroeconomics (business cycles, inflation, unemployment, economic growth).

Is freedom an inalienable property of the individual upon which nothing should impinge, or is it something human beings create together, in ways which necessarily involve collaboration and compromise? How should we prioritize the value of freedom in relation to other values, such as fairness, prosperity, and sustainability?\nIn this class, we will investigate the philosophical stakes of questions such as these from a variety of theoretical and political standpoints. We will begin by closely reading much of the defining document of modern liberalism, John Stuart Mill's On Liberty. We will then consider various attempts to refine or challenge the liberal conception of freedom, in figures such as Isaiah Berlin, Hannah Arendt, Philip Pettit, Friedrich Hayek, Simone de Beauvoir, and Axel Honneth. Finally, we will consider the contemporary limits of liberalism and how to overcome them, as articulated by Franz Fanon, Angela Davis, Patrick Deneen, and Maeve Cooke."]],"o":"5","f":"5"}]},{"i":"002610","c":"WCAS","t":"Introduction to Political Philosophy","u":"PHIL","n":"261-0","s":[{"i":"002610-20","r":[{"n":"Mauricio Maluff Masi"}],"t":"Introduction to Political Philosophy","u":"PHIL","n":"261-0","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2025-06-23","e":"2025-07-27","c":"LEC","a":30,"p":[["Overview of class","This course is an introduction to some of the core problems of political philosophy.

A combination of class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences will convey a sense of the foundational questions and methods of psychological science. Overall, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, several hours of an online laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have first¬hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be substituted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must use the paper requirement to satisfy your laboratory credit."],["Teaching Method","This class will be taught through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous methods. From 10:00 - 12:00 on Tues/Thurs we will meet synchronously via Zoom for a combination of lecture and discussion/group activities. Two hours per week of asynchronous activities will also be required. These will include videos of lectures on additional topics, podcasts, and other activities. The two hours per week of asynchronous work are in addition to assigned readings for the course."],["Class Materials (Required)","Gazzaniga, M. (2022). Psychological Science, 7th edition. W.W.
