It will explore different types of musical performances, the career paths and obstacles faced by well-known and unfairly forgotten performers, and consider ongoing controversies about performance. Specific issues will include mythic narratives of musicianship, the past and present development of historically informed performance and what these mean for conservatory students in 2022, African and Asian musicians across time and space, questions of gender and race in popular music and art music past and present, and histories of performance at Northwestern, among others. By these means, music students will gain introductory literacy in diverse types of music and performance practices, learn about the legacies of specific musicians, and better understand intersections between creativity and commerce in diverse contexts, all grounded by the idea of performance. Students will learn how to use archived material across media to conduct individual research on musicians from past and present, including crossover between genres and their own musical heritage."],["Registration Requirements","Music Majors Only"],["Learning Objectives","-Learn about diverse musicians, their legacies, and the circumstances of their performances in varied global contexts\n-Conceive of music history through the lens of performers rather than through the composer or the work\n-Develop a sense of how the concept of work differs from the concept of performance, and engage, where applicable, with notions of performance practices\n-Develop music research skills and verbal communication skills about music\n-Historicize and locate yourself and others within a complex world of musicians across genres"],["Class Materials (Required)","Nor textbook purchase required."]]}]},{"i":"003531","c":"MUSIC","t":"Aural Skills

This complexity of historical process and multiplicity of compositional techniques is obliterated by the uniformity of analytical method (pitch-class set theory) that dominates the field of post-tonal analysis today. The course will not be a systematic presentation of this method, but a series of glimpses into compositional techniques developed by some of the most prominent twentieth-century composers, and it will teach you how to use concepts derived from these techniques in analysis of their music. This twofold—theoretical and analytical—orientation will be reflected in the course design, in which discussion of concepts will be followed by analytical exercises. The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussion (20%), and two analytical papers (40% each).

This applies not just to individuals but also to communities and is equally valid for research fields. The History of Music Theory course retraces the pedigree of this discipline not in the spirit of an antiquarian exercise but as a discovery of its intellectual heritage which has manifold implications for today's music-theoretical discourse. The course covers the developments of music theory from Johann Mattheson (1681-1764) to Heinrich Schenker (1868-1935) and focuses on the most important debates and controversies that divided the field in this period. The readings of primary and secondary sources and in-class discussions will help you understand how positions of different parties were conditioned by different trends within the musical and intellectual culture of their times and how they resonate (or not) with current positions in the field of music theory. The course will have a seminar format. The assessment will include your preparation for and participation in the discussions (20%), presentation (20%), annotated bibliography (20%), and a final paper (40%)."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the class the student will be expected to have become familiar with the main ideas and concepts developed by music theorists from Johann Mattheson to Heinrich Schenker and understood the conflicting positions taken by different parties in the main debates and controversies that took place in the field of music theory in this period."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbooks required."]]}]},{"i":"024631","c":"MUSIC","t":"Seminar in Music Theory","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"550-0","s":[{"i":"024631-1","r":[{"n":"Daniel T Shanahan"}],"t":"Seminar in Music Theory","k":"Musical Transmission and Change","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"550-0","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["RCMA 1-176"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":10}]},{"i":"003834","c":"MUSIC","t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":[{"i":"003834-1","r":[{"n":"James F Giles","p":"847/491-5733","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003834-2","r":[{"n":"Sylvia Wang","p":"847/491-3906","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":"2","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003834-3","r":[{"n":"Christopher Michael Guzman"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":"3","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"}]},{"i":"003836","c":"MUSIC","t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":[{"i":"003836-1","r":[{"n":"James F Giles","p":"847/491-5733","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003836-2","r":[{"n":"Sylvia Wang","p":"847/491-3906","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":"2","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003836-3","r":[{"n":"Christopher Michael Guzman"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":"3","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"}]},{"i":"018278","c":"MUSIC","t":"Optional Recital","u":"PIANO","n":"305-0","s":[{"i":"018278-1","r":[{"n":"James F Giles","p":"847/491-5733","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Optional Recital","u":"PIANO","n":"305-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"PED","a":20}]},{"i":"003839","c":"MUSIC","t":"Piano Repertoire II","u":"PIANO","n":"313-2","s":[{"i":"003839-1","r":[{"n":"Rodolfo Augusto Faistauer"}],"t":"Piano Repertoire II","u":"PIANO","n":"313-2","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA 3-131"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":12,"p":[["Overview of class","Explore selected composers and works that form the vast repertoire written for keyboard instruments.

In addition, you will be expected to know which sections are solo or soli in any complete piece being studied."],["Teaching Method","This is a performance class. Each week, students enrolled in the class will play 2-3 different excerpts for the class, receiving feedback from the professor as well as students in the class. You are welcome to use repertoire lists for upcoming or past professional auditions, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the New World Symphony, summer festivals, or graduate school auditions. There should be a mix of styles, composers, and difficulty so that you gather a list of excerpts that reflects what an audition committee would need to hear; excerpts that demonstrate the skills needed by an orchestral flutist/piccolo player. (If performing an excerpt that has previously been learned, please memorize the excerpt as a new way of working on it.) We will hold a mock audition at the end of the quarter. In the mock audition, playing for your peers will help to simulate a live audition experience."],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be determined as follows:\nPerformance in weekly class: 50 %\nListening/score study: 10%\nMock audition performance: 30 %\nOverall contribution to the class environment: 10%"],["Class Materials (Required)","Students are not required to purchase a specific excerpt book.

In the US, penal control has become the main social response to crime. However, during the last few decades, some competing notions of justice have emerged and been applied in criminal legal systems. These notions include procedural justice, therapeutic-oriented justice, problem-solving justice, community-based justice, and restorative justice. Using a comparative lens, this course will introduce a variety of therapeutic, restorative, and problem-solving mechanisms that have been developed and implemented in criminal justice systems both in the US and worldwide. We will explore the potential of the criminal justice system by adopting non-punitive notions of justice to achieve goals that go beyond its classic, traditional goals, such as enhancing the well-being of its various stakeholders, empowering communities, restoring relationships between law-breakers and victims, encouraging reconciliation, and providing holistic rehabilitation to offenders. The course will address the tension between the criminal justice system's traditional goals and the therapeutic-oriented goals. We will discuss the question of whether the criminal justice system is the right domain to promote therapeutic goals given the potential risks of net-widening, stigmatization and its collateral consequences, deprivation of due process rights, paternalism, and coercion that arise when therapeutically oriented goals are promoted within the criminal legal regime, especially in societies that suffer from racial and socio-economic inequalities."],["Evaluation Method","10 - Mandatory Attendance\n60 - Active and significant class participation (significant engagement during class discussions and activities, speaking in class, referring to reading materials, contributing ideas and reflections)\n20 - Response paper and presentation of a supplementary reading assignment\n10 - Short Reflection paper"],["Class Notes","This course will be taught in a condensed way to pedagogically maximize experiential learning and to enable the students to develop an understanding of the multi-dimensional notion of justice in the criminal legal context. The course consists of 5 days (an online Zoom meeting on December 18th + four days of in-person instruction on January 2-5), each focusing on various distinct meanings of justice in the criminal sphere. Each meeting contains learning units that are connected and correspond with each other. The discussions in each of the meetings will be based on the observations and insights gained in previous meetings. Due to the broad timeframe of each meeting, the students will be able to engage deeply and thoroughly with ideas and critiques that relate to each of these notions and establish a comprehensive understanding of each of these notions and their interplays. The timeframe devoted to each meeting would allow us to combine theoretical learning with experiential activities, creating a sequence of learning experiences that a scattered course cannot provide. Sessions of theoretical discussion on abstract principles will be followed by class activities, such as watching documentaries and videos and analyzing them together; working in small groups on hypothetical or illustrative cases, and conducting a restorative community circle in class."]]}]},{"i":"018978","c":"LAW","t":"Advanced Negotiation Workshop","u":"LITARB","n":"672","s":[{"i":"018978-1","r":[{"n":"Lynn P Cohn","p":"312/503-2598","a":"420 E.

We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see. We will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic. We will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources.

South Asian businesses on Devon Avenue sell paratha and saris, and community centers support newly settled families. Shops in Chinatown on Cermak Road sell traditional herbal cures and non-profits focus on immigrant rights and health concerns. A volunteer-run school in the suburb of Des Plaines offers weekly Mandarin lessons to first, second and third generation Chinese-American families who hope their American-born children will stay connected to their roots.

Kamala Harris is the first Black and South Asian American candidate on a major party's presidential ticket.

Still, while Marvel featured Shang Chi and K-Pop tops U.S. Billboard charts, anti-Asian rhetoric, discrimination and attacks rose. Asian Americans are confronting their own bias and racism, as well. We will study journalistic work that explore the complex histories of Asians who have settled in the United States since before this nation's founding, the discrimination people faced and the opportunities they pursued. We will hear from and about Asian American journalists, activists, artists and leaders. This class is for anyone who wants to better understand the role of media and journalists covering communities of color. We will explore issues of identity, race and ethnicity, nationality and class.

Think of this as a master class in interviewing. What are the best techniques to get people to feel comfortable opening up? How do we get to know people's stories? What are the ethical issues that arise in this kind of work? We'll read the masters, from Studs Terkel to the Nobel Prize-winning Svetlana Alexievich to Anna Deavere Smith. We'll read excerpts of oral histories on Black soldiers in Vietnam, on an archive on hip-hop, on refugees, on our time under COVID. We'll listen to radio including Joe Richman's Radio Diaries and StoryCorps. We'll watch films like Flee, the animated story of an Afghan refugee told in his own words. We'll come to appreciate the power of the human voice. This is a relatively new way of telling journalistic stories, and so we'll look at how journalists are experimenting with this form.

More than 20 million Asians live in the U.S. and trace their roots to 19 groups in Asia. The Chicago region is home to an Asian American population that is ethnically, racially, culturally and economically diverse. South Asian businesses on Devon Avenue sell paratha and saris, and community centers support newly settled families. Shops in Chinatown on Cermak Road sell traditional herbal cures and non-profits focus on immigrant rights and health concerns. A volunteer-run school in the suburb of Des Plaines offers weekly Mandarin lessons to first, second and third generation Chinese-American families who hope their American-born children will stay connected to their roots. A Chicago improv troupe called Stir Friday Night, made up of up-and-coming Asian American comedians, has performed for more than 25 years. In this course, we will explore and produce stories of Asian Americans at a pivotal time in history. Asian American cultural, social and political influence is on the rise. Kamala Harris is the first Black and South Asian American candidate on a major party's presidential ticket. Minnesota native Sunisa Lee became the first Hmong American to participate in the Olympics and the became the first Asian American to win an all-around gymnastics gold medal. Still, while Marvel featured Shang Chi and K-Pop tops U.S. Billboard charts, anti-Asian rhetoric, discrimination and attacks rose. Asian Americans are confronting their own bias and racism, as well. We will study journalistic work that explore the complex histories of Asians who have settled in the United States since before this nation's founding, the discrimination people faced and the opportunities they pursued. We will hear from and about Asian American journalists, activists, artists and leaders. This class is for anyone who wants to better understand the role of media and journalists covering communities of color. We will explore issues of identity, race and ethnicity, nationality and class. We will learn to report in and about communities with sensitivity, address cultural and language differences and practice journalism of empathy. We produce stories in a variety of media.

This topic will continue to be our focus in 2024. In 2022, the Medill Investigative Program produced a series of investigations of toxic coal ash, published by Energy News Network and Detroit Public TV and including a TV feature. Students traveled to report in locations including Montana, New York, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee. In this program, we use investigative tools and techniques including FOIAs and public records, court documents, data, mapping, on-the-ground scouting, interviews and other research to shed light on injustice and inequity. We will use a social justice and solutions journalism lens, exploring, quantifying and chronicling how the policies and practices of government agencies, corporations or other entities impact real people, and how things might be changed for the better.

The first objective is to try to understand how and why \"democracy\" today has come to be regarded as the only \"legitimate\" form of government. This was not always the case. After a brief and dramatic appearance more than two thousand years ago in the ancient Greece, \"democracy\" was regarded more often negatively as a dangerous and unstable form of government susceptible excesses of both \"voice and violence.\" However, starting in the late eighteenth century in the aftermath of two great revolutions, the American and the French, followed by the end of the Second World War in 1945 and the end of the Cold War in 1991, democracy has had a series of spectacular ascents. Today democracy is seen as the only viable and legitimate form of \"self-governance\" and as an expression of \"popular sovereignty.\" How did this happen? The second objective is to examine the growing disenchantment with democracy in the very midst of its triumphal march. The discontent with democratic governance is no longer confined to \"new democracies\" in poor or developing countries where they are often afflicted with massive corruption, demagogic leadership, and electoral violence and fraud. Increasingly mature democracies in advanced countries in Europe and North America are also suffering from a legitimacy deficit due to issues related to economic inequality, a high rate of unemployment or chronic under-employment, immigration, racial and religious conflicts. This is evident from the resurgence of populism, especially authoritarian versions of populism, in recent decades in many parts of the world. This, in turn, has given rise to growing chatter about the coming death of democracy. In this course, we will primarily focus on the following question: How can these two seemingly contradictory claims about democracy- the reports about its impending death and need for its continuing existence for securing legitimacy to govern- plausibly coexist and have currency in political discourse and thinking today."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbook required."]]}]},{"i":"011459","c":"SPCH","t":"Rhetoric of U.S. Women's Rights, Colonial to 1920","u":"COMM_ST","n":"324-1","s":[{"i":"011459-1","r":[{"n":"Angela Ray"}],"t":"Rhetoric of U.S. Women's Rights, Colonial to 1920","u":"COMM_ST","n":"324-1","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G30"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","Students in this course investigate the early U.S. women's rights movement through the analysis of primary texts and the examination of critical essays.

We will study the relationship of African American English to linguistic theory, education policy, justice and U.S. culture. The course has an emphasis on mitigating discrimination and improving the educational and social experiences of African-Americans at Northwestern and beyond. Some topic areas include:\n(1) Present-Day Patterns of African American Vernacular English (AAE, aka Ebonics), its vocabulary (lexicon), pronunciation (phonetics and phonology) and grammar (morphology and syntax), as exemplified primarily in the informal vernacular speech of African Americans.\n(2) The Living Art: How AAE is expressively employed by writers, comedians, actors, singers, toasters and rappers, and is deployed in African American speech events or routines.\n(3) Education and other applied issues connected with the use of AAE: attitudes towards this variety and their effects on teachers' expectations and students' progress; linguistic profiling and discrimination in employment, housing, and Disney cartoons; the extent to which AAE affects the learning of Standard English and the acquisition of reading skills. We'll consider controversies about whether AAE should be \"wiped out\" or used as a basis for the teaching of initial literacy skills and Standard English mastery in the classroom, e.g., in the Ann Arbor \"King\" case of 1977-79, and the Oakland Ebonics resolutions of 1996, including the response of the media, public, humorists, legislators, and linguists.\n(4) Law and Criminal Justice, examining the extent to which the English vernacular used by African Americans and their bretheren and sisteren in Africa or the Diaspora, affects the way they are \"heard\" and judged as suspects, defendants or witnesses. We have some good evidence of the way in which dialect unfamiliarity and prejudice had a negative impact on the reception of the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, close friend of Trayvon Martin, in the trial of George Zimmerman."]]}]},{"i":"004535","c":"SPCH","t":"Language Development and Usage","u":"CSD","n":"392-0","s":[{"i":"004535-1","r":[{"n":"Elizabeth Spencer Norton"}],"t":"Language Development and Usage","u":"CSD","n":"392-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 2370"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":32,"p":[["Overview of class","Development of spoken and written language as it relates to child development; includes phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic components.

This class is an open-ended investigation into why this kind of story is emerging. Our class begins with a prominent recent instance of the phenomenon (Watchmen) before looking to the roots of the genre in the essay film (Two or Three Things I Know About Her, F For Fake). We then consider key bent story cases in contemporary TV and podcasting that deal with queerness (Nanette, S-Town), at the same time introducing students to aspects of genre theory. In the second half of the course, we consider contemporary cultural theory about media consumption alongside three types of genre turn films: aestheticized meta noir and meta horror (Dark City, From Dusk Til Dawn), narrative melodramas that turn into critiques of heteronormativity (Certified Copy, Kevin can F*** Himself) and high-concept rhetorical art films that seem, on the surface, to represent \"turns against\" neoliberal and capitalist logics (Bacurau, Parasite)."],["Registration Requirements","This class is open to all, with a maximum enrollment of 12.

These plays, like all theatrical performances, are fundamentally embedded in their historical contexts. How have these depictions shaped and have been shaped by US cultural and political history?

We work at this by becoming aware of 3 sensations: --how gravity's force - when we give in to it - relaxes our body-weight down into the floor and, therefore, frees our bones to move more loosely at their bony connections called joints (e.g., the neck, elbows, lower back, and knees); --how the floor, in application of Newton's law, meets our thrusting-downward, falling body-weight by equally and oppositely counter-thrusting up into it; --how you and your partner use your hands, eyes, and voices to share your emotioninfused, rhythmic movement with each other in equal and opposite pushes and pulls while bouncing downward onto the beat of the great American folk music called swing.

To discover how to do monologues and scenes in this relaxed-but-powerful way without strain and without injury, we study the anatomy of the body. We do this to discover how Nature has constructed the body to work rather than how our too-often misguidedly overthinking human mind thinks the body should work. Knowing how to use our voices and bodies according to the laws of Nature can not only unlock the physical-emotional energy in our acting. It can also unlock this energy in our humanity. That is, the work of this class involves discovering how being vulnerable, grounded, and direct can fuel being vulnerable, grounded, and direct as a person as well as an actor. Describing with more particularity the physical-emotional work of the class . . . . SDS explores how the human body is designed to work with gravity than against gravity. That is, by learning slowly - to emphasize, learning slowly - how to use gravity's cost-free, always-available support, we explore how to perform any movement or vocalization more by letting go of the muscle-encased bones of our body than by hypertensely holding on to them. In sum, we learn to work with greater efficiency. Working with greater efficiency means learning how to use the least amount of energy - emotional as well as physical energy - to complete a task. A synonym for working in a more efficient way is working in a less is more way In SDS, we apply this less-is-more way of working to our warm-up exercises. Given the goal of letting go of our bones rather than holding on to them, these exercises focus on teaching our bones - which we'll learn to identify the form and function of in the anatomy-focused part of class - to gently give in to the downward pull of gravity rather than hypertensely resist its downward pull. Toward this goal, we learn how to free our bones go where they want to go instead of where we - possibly influenced by a previous, anti-gravity instruction - think they should go. To help get our heads around this admittedly quite challenging giving-in-rather-than-holding-on point of view, we - again - slow down. We slow down maybe a bit more than we speeding multitaskers might want to in order to weave the following three actions into the exercises: 1) exhale so as to release unneeded physical and emotional tensions; 2) let go of the bones of the body by sensing where gravity \"wants\" them to go: down 3) team up the movement of the eyes, hands, and voice so that, in unison, they can direct us to get what we want with LESS physical and emotional strain and MORE physical and emotional power."]]}]},{"i":"022906","c":"SPCH","t":"Special Topics in Acting","u":"THEATRE","n":"370-0","s":[{"i":"022906-20","r":[{"n":"Tracy Cecile Davis"},{"n":"David S Catlin"}],"t":"Special Topics in Acting","u":"THEATRE","n":"370-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Wirtz 201 Performnce Black Box"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","The Great Sea Serpent poses various kinds of acting and devising challenges, including creating the various \"worlds\" in which action occurs, creating and manipulating various kinds of puppetry and performing objects, integrating vocal and physical work with music and sound, bringing scientific research into the actor's process.

Staging, or the arrangement and movement of performers on camera, is the key area of collaboration between directors, actors and cinematographers and perhaps is the most essential element of visual design in cinema (necessary even before lighting and editing can do their expressive work). This course will develop basic skills in designing dramatic and dynamic relationships between performers and camera through hands-on exercises in class and shooting in the field. You will introduce and practice different styles of coverage (for example, long-take vs. analytical montage) and camera technique (dolly vs. handheld vs. tripod).

The second part is a production class which will run in the spring (likely Thursdays 11am-150pm). Four plays from part one of the class will be selected to receive workshop productions in part two. This will culminate in a weekend festival in June where the produced plays will be showcased.

There has since been considerable critique of stress as the defining feature of adolescence, and recently researchers have focused on the many assets of adolescents and the opportunities of this developmental period (National Academies of Sciences & Medicine, 2019). The experience and consequences of stress do, however, represent important features of adolescence, as well as early adulthood. While complete coverage of the extensive literature on adolescent and young adult stress is not possible, in this course, we begin to explore some central questions. Why are adolescence and early adulthood stressful periods of life? Are they more stressful now than in the past? How do we best define and measure adolescent and young adult stress? What are some key sources of stress during these developmental periods? What are the major biological stress response systems of the body, and how are they impacted by stress and normative developmental change? What are the implications of stress, and biological stress responses, for adolescent and young adult health and developmental outcomes? What factors reduce adolescent stress and its impact on youth outcomes? How might this knowledge be leveraged to develop and implement interventions to improve the wellbeing of adolescents and young adults? This course is an advanced, interactive, undergraduate class in which the instructor, TA, and students will explore the set of above questions together, through readings, discussions, and through quantitative and qualitative coding and analysis of datasets on adolescent stress. Students will have the opportunity to pose questions and hypotheses regarding adolescent stress and examine these hypotheses empirically as part of a group final project (based on available data). Ultimately, the class goals are to a) teach students about the science of and current knowledge on adolescent stress and b) have students begin to get comfortable posing and answering questions using data analysis and c) to help reduce student stress through increased understanding of stress and factors which contribute to and reduce stress."],["Registration Requirements","Prerequisites: (SESP 201-0) and (SESP 210-0 or any 200-level Statistics Equivalent)."],["Teaching Method","Assignments, no tests"],["Class Materials (Required)","SPSS statistical software, approximately $50.

At the same time, these technologies are born and shaped by the societies in which they are developed. Thus, grappling with the ethics of technologies (i.e considering the harms and benefits, how and why they were created in the first place, and how and to what ends they are used) is important not only for ultimately creating more moral technologies but a more moral society. Thus, our approach to the ethics of computing technologies requires a multifaceted assessment of their harm and benefit to our individual, cultural, and political lives, and simultaneously a critical examination of the values, ideologies, and contexts through which computing technologies emerge. To accomplish this, we will engage in critical reading across a range of topics drawn from computer science and HCI, education and learning sciences, as well as ethics and philosophy. These readings and ideas will help us to: --Recognize the value judgements and subjectivities that undergird a wide variety of technical practices (e.g. sampling, data collection practices, categorization and classification, prediction, system design, etc.).\nExamine the design choices and tradeoffs that various computing infrastructures make (and have made) in relation to important societal values (e.g. individual autonomy, free speech, equity, privacy, justice, security, access to opportunity, etc.). --Consider some of the intended and unintended consequences of computing applications within our communities, institutions, and social systems (e.g. schooling, employment, policing, transportation, business, etc.).

Skilled educators continually take experiences from the field in the form of observations, curiosities, and challenges to inform structured inquiry—with the purpose of improving conceptual and pedagogical understandings for themselves and their students. MSED 407-1 & 407-2 are grounded in a model of action research. In our view, action research is not distinct from the work of teaching and educating, rather when done well it drives the work of teaching and learning. Data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings on a daily basis—we are responsible for mining and learning from them. As a result of these courses you will not only have designed and conducted action research— your Master's Project —but more importantly, you will have a set of stances and tools to embark on a career as an educator scholar who continues to notice various aspects of teaching and learning, ask important questions, and engage in meaningful, guided examinations of practice to evolve learning. The goal of MSED 407-1 and 407-2 is to help you become informed educators who are able to turn curiosities and challenges from your settings into potential areas of structured reflection and research. The basis of the course is the model of action research — of studying our own settings around questions we are passionate about, for the purpose of improving our students and colleagues learning as well as our own practice. Action research is not distinct from the work of teaching, rather the data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings daily. As a result of these courses you will not only have conducted action research— your Master's Project —more importantly, you will have the tools to embark on a career as an educator scholar who continues to ask important questions and embark on meaningful, systematic examinations of teaching and learning in your selected setting. During MSED 407-1, you chose a question that was of personal importance to you. You reviewed relevant literature related to this question, you identified different types of classroom data to investigate this question. During MSED 407, we will focus on techniques for analyzing the data that you have collected, revisit the literature surrounding our project, and consider how the work will influence your teaching and learning moving forward.

The second part of the course will explore policies designed to address the causes and consequences of inequality. We will also learn about fundamental economic concepts - including opportunity cost, comparative advantage, supply and demand, human capital, and individual responses to incentives - as a way to critically examine the effectiveness of these policies.

The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-indifference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. We will also discuss causal evidence derived from theoretical models and machine learning. Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (\"happiness\") are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. They matter as an outcome for people's lives and they matter as an input into economic and social productivity. Moreover, health, human capital, and happiness are impacted by behaviors and by social and environmental conditions - factors that can be impacted via social policies. To develop effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. We will discuss fetal origins, the impact of air pollution on health, causes and consequences of mental illness in childhood and youth, the impact of income on health, trends in mortality, the economic drivers of fertility, happiness across countries and over time, and the roots of midlife crisis."],["Registration Requirements","Any of these three courses are required as a prerequisite: SESP 310: Causal Methods for Evaluating Policy\nECON 281: Applied Econometrics\nSTAT 328: Causal Inference Exceptions are possible but require our specific permission.

We will then consider one cause and solution of poverty for families—education—from early childhood to adulthood. Throughout the quarter, we will critically evaluate public policy and scientific research through a social justice, anti-racist lens with an eye towards a more inclusive and equitable society.

Class discussions will complement the material presented in the lecture by encouraging you to reflect on your own experiences and providing a platform for diverse perspectives to be shared within our classroom community. These materials and discussion may help you to challenge assumptions you may unknowingly hold and gain insight on how it has shaped your perspective and behavior.

Beginning in the mid-1800s, social and political theorists such as Marx, Weber, Freud, Durkheim, and more posited that with modernization religion would play a decreasingly important role, as the world marched inextricably towards secularization. This reality, however, has never come to fruition. From the founding of the United States as nation, to nearly every large-scale social justice movement, to the missions and actions of hate groups, to contemporary local school board meetings, and so on, religion is fundamentally woven into the fabric of American culture and politics and continues to play a key (sometimes explicit, sometimes hidden) role in shaping policymaking at all levels. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, this seminar-style course will seek to understand the role that religion plays in contemporary American politics and policy, broadly defined. By looking at how religions and religious beliefs interact with a variety of other types of individual and collective identities and discourses, such as ethnicity, race, gender, and American-ness, we will aim to gain insight into the importance and role of religion in the distribution of power and resources, in shaping and constraining democratic processes and social change, and in the self-concept and role/actions of the US worldwide."]]}]},{"i":"017367","c":"SESP","t":"Social, Cultural, and Linguistic Contexts of Education","u":"TEACH_ED","n":"302-0","s":[{"i":"017367-20","r":[{"n":"Timothy Scott Hayes"},{"n":"Corrie L Cockrell"}],"t":"Social, Cultural, and Linguistic Contexts of Education","u":"TEACH_ED","n":"302-0","s":"20","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":10,"p":[["Overview of class","This course is designed to explore how the ways that we live culturally provide strengths for teaching, learning and design.

Issues of legality, bias, non- discriminatory policies, and ethical considerations that must accompany decisions about standards and practices used in the assessment of culturally and linguistically diverse students will be explored. Candidates will be asked to examine policies facing educators of linguistically diverse learners over the last century, and articulate multiple perspectives associated with the issue drawing from course readings and outside research.\nThe focus on current practices and trends will include key assignments inviting candidates to examine policies and processes associated with the selection and interpretation of mandated assessments and practices at multiple levels-state, district, school and classroom as they relate to diagnostics, language, and achievement. Candidates will answer questions such as \"How did these tools get selected? In what ways do they support or disadvantage linguistically diverse students?

First, profit-seeking firms may try to reduce competition through price discrimination, resale price maintenance, entry deterrence, predation, horizontal mergers, vertical integration, or collusion. We will use economic theory and landmark legal cases to study the purpose and development of antitrust law, which is meant to reduce the adverse effects of anti-competitive business practices. Next, large fixed costs of building and maintaining a physical network may generate natural monopolies in markets for electric power, cable television, natural gas, and water. We will explore the challenges regulators face when they attempt to apply market controls such as price caps so an essential service remains affordable. We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of winner-take-all markets, in which bandwagon effects result in convergence to a single operating system, recording technology, or social network. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate. We will analyze the ideal scope of artificial monopoly rights and the natural tension between intellectual property and antitrust law.

The writing drills can help students determine whether to pursue additional journalism courses at Northwestern University or elsewhere - and ultimately whether one has the potential to become a published nonfiction writer.

We will examine the nature of a profession and the reasons professional ethics are necessary, and we will look at specific moral issues like deception, confidentiality, whistleblowing, and sustainability. We will look in detail at moral issues in specific professions like medicine, business, law, and public health, though the course is intended as an introduction to professional ethics in general. This is a philosophy course, so our aim is not to memorize a list of do's and don'ts. Rather, our goal is to understand and critically assess the moral theories and principles that ethicists have developed to address problems in professional ethics. This course will thus help you develop your skills in understanding, analyzing, and constructing arguments. The course is conducted completely online. A technology fee will be added to tuition."],["Registration Requirements","Note: This course is limited to School of Professional Studies students only.

What sexual assumptions underpin studies of the Middle East? And what kind of a Middle East grounds gender and sexuality studies in the region? This course engages with queer studies and critical race and feminist scholarship in anthropology, history, and sociology to probe these questions. In this course, we will attend to the formation of \"gender\" and \"sexuality\" as categories of sociocultural analysis, surveying the major shifts within the intellectual history of gender and sexuality studies, while interrogating the ways in which race, class, and nationality complicate studies of gender and sexuality and of mobility alike. In other words, if one major question that animates the course is what intersectional studies of mobility have to contribute to historical and anthropological studies of gender and sexuality in the Middle East, the other is what kind of new analytical ground studies of gender and sexuality could open up in sociocultural analysis of mobility, migration and transnationalism across the Middle East and Southwest Asia."]]}]},{"i":"017942","c":"TGS","t":"Literature, Medicine, and Bioethics","u":"MHB","n":"404-0","s":[{"i":"017942-20","r":[{"n":"Catherine Francis Belling"}],"t":"Literature,

The questions we will examine include: In a racially and ethnically diverse (even divided) nation, what constitutes American identity, the quality of \"Americanness\"? Who, if anyone, speaks for all Americans? What sort of literary voice best expresses American realities and ideals? How does the dynamic of culture and counter-culture, dominant and marginal, get worked out aesthetically and ideologically?"],["Learning Objectives","Demonstrate orally and in writing an advanced undergraduate understanding of American Novels in relation to the course topic.

We consider the Renaissance as a moment of origin for later ideologies that promote the human domination of nature (with all its negative consequences for both human beings and extra-human life) but we also look at alternative ideas and traditions within and outside of the European context that point to more holistic notions of the interconnections of living (and, sometimes, nonliving) beings.

Nineteenth-century Paris was also the capital of an empire that stretched from North and West Africa to the Caribbean and Polynesia. The foreign bodies and objects that filled the city as a result of these imperial conditions dramatically shaped the evolution of French art. This course explores art in Paris at the intersection of modern politics, colonialism, and capitalist industrialization. In addition to avant-garde painting movements such as Impressionism and its \"post-Impressionist\" challengers, we also examine Orientalism and Primitivism alongside academic sculpture, universal exhibitions, and reproductive technologies like photography and the illustrated press.

Europe's mercantile interests opened the door to professional artists such as Thomas and William Daniel, William Hodges, and Johann Zoffany who made their careers through their Indian expeditions. On the other hand, British women such as Emily Eden and Fanny Parkes who traveled and lived in British India, produced their own sketches and impressions.

The course is designed to provide students with an authentic laboratory experience that investigates relevant scientific research and teaches scientific inquiry skills such as experimental design, writing research proposals, data collection, data analysis/interpretation, and the presentation of results. The experimental model revolves around aggregate prone proteins in nematodes and how RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to affect protein folding and the clearance of protein aggregates. Students will learn and become proficient at various cell and molecular biology techniques."]]},{"i":"023853-60","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"60","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG36"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-61","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"61","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG72"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-62","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"62","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG78"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-63","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"63","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG82"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-64","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"64","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG36"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-65","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"65","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG72"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-66","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"66","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG78"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-67","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"67","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG82"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-68","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"68","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG36"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-72","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"72","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG36"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-73","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"73","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG72"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-76","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"76","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG36"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-77","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"77","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG72"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-78","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"78","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG78"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"},{"i":"023853-79","t":"Genetics and Molecular Processes Laboratory","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"233-0","s":"79","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG78"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LAB"}]},{"i":"001397","c":"WCAS","t":"Human Physiology","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"310-0","s":[{"i":"001397-1","r":[{"n":"Tracy M Hodgson","p":"847/491-4823","a":"Tech Institute, Room MG77","o":"TBA"}],"t":"Human Physiology","u":"BIOL_SCI","n":"310-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Technological Institute M164"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":50,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisites: Students must have completed BIOL_SCI 201-0, BIOL_SCI 202-0, and CHEM 132-0, CHEM 152-0, or CHEM 172-0.","p":[["Overview of class","Biol_Sci 310 explores the functions of the human body with an emphasis on homeostatic mechanisms, interdependence of organs and organ systems and the influence of modulatory systems.

The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements. Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector. To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management. Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends. The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.

Throughout this period, American business has seen a transformation in the way risk is evaluated, capital is raised, and organizations are led. The \"rules of the game\" during this period have changed radically in terms of corporate control, business management and wealth creation. We will explore the transformations in business and commerce during the past four decades that have led to current trends and problems. Students interested in the recent history of Wall Street, financial markets, and business culture will enjoy this class. It will also appeal to students intrigued by late 20th and early 21st century American society - specifically how business and American industries have influenced America's identity. Those who may want to explore a career in business should find the seminar helpful in preparing for many types of professions across disciplines. Students will be exposed to topics such as leveraged buyouts, junk bonds, venture capital investing, the \"Internet Bubble\", entrepreneurial management, hedge funds, and derivatives. In addition, we will explore public policy trends around issues including corporate takeovers, technology transfers, risk management, government bailouts and business investment. A common theme throughout the quarter will be how capitalism has evolved over the past few decades, and how this has changed the mindset of business professionals and the American workforce. It will be up to you to determine if this evolution has been beneficial or detrimental to American society.

How can one navigate its dictate when one is caught between revenge and redemption in Kikuchi Kan's Beyond the Pale of Vengeance? What is its role in contemporary anti-war narratives and medical ethics? Above all, how does world literature respond to the problems of conscience that face the world at large?

For more than five-hundred years the legend of Faust has served as a way of expressing the danger of pursuing an aspiration to the point of losing one's own selfhood. The specter of a \"Faustian bargain\" appears whenever an inordinate achievement seems to arise from a destructive or self-destructive source. The theme of Faust thus provides a series of perspectives through which one can begin to reflect on one's highest values. Dr. Faustus has undergone many mutations since he first appeared in central Europe around the early sixteenth century. This class will begin with a question at the foundation of the Faust legend: what is a \"soul,\" and what is worth? While examining these and kindred questions about the nature of the self, the class will continually reflect on what we are doing when we evaluate a work of art in relation to the culture of its historical period. We begin by examining the earliest versions of Faust, which derives from the earliest days of the Protestant Reformation. We proceed to read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's world-renowned drama involving the desire for cosmic knowledge and the lures of sexual intoxication (\"Faust, Part I\"), followed by its strange sequel (\"Faust, Part II\"), which culminates in Faust becoming a social reformer who wants to alter the very organizing of the earth. We will ask what Goethe, near the end of his life, gave to \"world literature\" (a term of his own invention) when he presented his final version of Faust as a man committed to a total terrestrial transformation. And in the final weeks of the class, we turn to Hollywood film, so that we can re-evaluate the Faust legend from the perspective of a modern medium in our own historical period, concluding with Danny Boyle's \"Yesterday\" and Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie.\""],["Learning Objectives","Learning Objectives: •\tTo gain a knowledge of a major legend of modern culture\n•\tTo gain an understanding of central European cultural history particular attention to the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and Romanticism.\n•\tTo develop and expand the skills necessary for writing a critical essay on a complex literary work.\n•\tTo gain a familiarity with the difference between analyzing a literary work and cinematic one."],["Teaching Method","Lecture"],["Evaluation Method","Class participation, Papers.

Particular attention will be devoted to questions of gender and race, as the memory of Italy's racial laws and colonial past in Africa was about to be dimmed by the cultural politics of postwar recovery and, later, the economic miracle. Mindful of this process of historical erasure, we will turn to the remarkable output of the 1960s and 1970s and analyze the way in which different directors (Fellini, Antonioni, Visconti, Rosi, Pasolini) treated the problems of industrialization, migration, and organized crime. Finally, we will assess the return of a documentary approach to reality in films like Garrone's Gomorra (Gomorrah, 2008) and Rosi's Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea, 2016) in the context of globalization and the resurgence of populism and right-wing politics.

The second, proposed by Kierkegaard under a variety of pseudonyms, presents aesthetics into a \"sphere of existence\" that consists, above all, in the avoidance of decision, beginning with the decision to marry. The first half of the seminar thus begins with a brief look at Kant's early inquiry into the \"finer feeling\" (1764) and then spends some time with the opening sections of the \"Kritik der Urteilskraft\" (Critique of Judgment, 1790). It continues with an inquiry into certain sections of Kierkegaard's \"Enten/Eller\" (Either/Or, 1841) and \"Frygt og Bæven\" (Fear and Trembling, 1843). The second half of the seminar revolves around the theory of beauty that Benjamin develops in the final section of a long essay he wrote in the early 1920s on Goethe's novel \"Die Wahlverwandtschaften\" (Elective Affinities, 1809). In preparation for reading Benjamin's essay and a set of related fragments on cognition, we will read and discuss Goethe's novel as well as a small number of his writings on nature and art.

We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services? This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies."],["Registration Requirements","Basic algebra and graphing.

Why were fluctuations larger in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century? Who gains and who suffers most because of fluctuations? How is inflation related to economic fluctuations? Why are fluctuations larger in developing economies than in developed economies? To understand the facts that we will document, we will consider modern general equilibrium theories of aggregate fluctuations. One important class of theories, Real Business Cycle theory, stresses the role of fluctuations in the rate of technology change. A different class of theories stresses the role of fluctuations in aggregate demand, including self-fulfilling changes in consumers' expectations. These theories have very different implications for optimal monetary and fiscal policy, which we will explore and evaluate.

We will study the problems of cities, urban areas, and regions by examining the effects of geographic location on the decisions of individuals and firms. The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance.

How do adaptations like these comment on and critique the original work and what do they tell us about our contemporary preoccupations and blind spots? In what ways do adaptations illuminate the original text for us in new ways? What makes an adaptation good or bad or faithful to the original? And why do we still love—or love to hate—so-called \"bad\" adaptations? In this course, we will explore how film, television, and novelistic adaptations of some of Austen's most popular works operate as critical and creative practices of storytelling. We will also consider how our responses to these adaptations reflect our own cultural investments as well as our reading and viewing habits. Some of the topics we will discuss in relation to adaptation include: the dynamics of race, class, and gender and sexuality; clichés and audience expectations; hate watching and ironic enjoyment."],["Evaluation Method","Canvas posts, discussion, writing assignments.

Do we even need to ask? Realism guarantees that the fictional worlds of novels, stories, films, and TV resemble our worlds. Realism obeys the laws of gravity; like us, realist characters grapple with social forces they cannot magically transcend. Most important of all, we know that realist texts are lifelike but not literally true—and yet, when we read Pride and Prejudice, we don't think Jane Austen is lying to us. How have we come to occupy this distinctive cognitive posture? How has fiction come to epitomize the limits and possibilities of the real? In English 300, we'll trace some key twists and turns in the emergence of British prose fiction that claimed to be lifelike. As it turns out, realism is a relatively recent literary invention with a turbulent history. We'll focus on texts and topics that shape the emergence of realism: the travel narrative, which tries to depict flora, fauna, and people that are inconceivable to an English audience; criminal biography, which exposes the duplicity of notorious characters to an eager reading public; and domestic fiction, which explores the tensions structuring family life. We'll read one novel that epitomizes nineteenth-century realism as social critique (by either Balzac or Dickens) before turning to two contemporary novels (Colson Whitehead, The Underground Railroad; Miriam Toews, Women Talking) that flout realist conventions while still affirming the urgency of their reference to the real.

We'll assess how his understanding of \"Nature\" and our relation to it changes over his career and also how it varies in the distinct ecologies of tragedy and comedy. The critical concept of Shakespearean \"green worlds\" first arose to describe those retreats into nature (and away from civilized society) that typically occur in the comedies. There, a removal to the \"green world\" serves to counteract one or another social ill, which in turn enables a rebalanced, healthier socio-political life to be restored. But how does this traditional and sometimes pastoral sense of a natural equilibrium hold up against a closer reading of the plays, especially if we consider comedies and tragedies together? Against what, exactly, is the human order of civil life defined and established, and from what threatening \"laws of nature\" is it supposed to defend us? How does our grasp of more contemporary human impacts on the environment illuminate Shakespeare's premodern vision of human existence as a calamity of exposure -- to hard weather and our own worst instincts, too?

Course Description: The course of true love never did run smooth and the novels of Jane Austen (1775-1817) are no exception. Austen's heroines typically are kept apart from her heroes by prudence, error, or \"low connections,\" during which time readers are treated to scandalous affairs involving dashing ne'er-do-wells, marriage proposals from petty fools, timely injuries to romantic rivals, and satirical portraits of various wannabes and oughtabes. As the song goes, however, love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage. Eventually, then, all of these obstacles are overcome and the heroine and hero marry, signifying a new social order that promises to be better than the old. What are we to make, however, of heroines who are not especially romantic, or even that likeable? Of all these stories taking place during the Napoleonic Wars, which are barely mentioned? Of nearly all Austen's heroines and heroes being members of the landed gentry at a time when their wealth was often derived from plantation slavery? Of the aristocratic values Austen champions at a time when democracy was finding its foothold in Europe and America? In short, our challenge will be to hold in our minds Austen's delightful genius and exquisite prose alongside what seems, at first glance at least, to be her dubious politics as we explore the extent to which her novels remain a productive field of engagement for our contemporary concerns.

Why are secrets so endemic in postcolonial culture in both the political and the personal realm, and how do they work? Colonial cultures have depended on secrets and lies to maintain order. But what are the implications for a society that remains silent about some of its darkest crimes and traumas? In this seminar, we will read three postcolonial novels set in three very distinct postcolonial cultures—Seamus Deane's Reading in the Dark (Northern Ireland), Arundati Roy's The God of Small Things (India), and Viet Thanh Nguyen's The Sympathizer (Vietnam and Los Angeles)—in order to think about these questions. We will consider how a legacy of violence—physical, psychic, and sexual—manifests itself when it cannot be spoken out loud. We will discuss how secrets and lies are both specific to place and context, and fit into a pattern of control and silencing that is recognizable across cultures. How can a code of silence create the conditions for traitors, informants, and double agents? How can fiction help to reveal some of these hidden codes and give voice to the silenced? Why might the horror genre be well suited to raising some of these questions?

And how does the graphic novel's popularity influence our understanding of the digital age and its dissemination of information?

The ensuing global contest between liberal democracy and rising totalitarianisms in a century of rapid technological and social change led to - and far beyond - World War II.

Pokagon strongly criticized the Fair's celebration of Columbus's \"discovery\" of the Americas in the book's text, but Pokagon's words are not the only form this critique takes. The birchbark pages, the illustrations, the process by which the books were made and printed: these elements extend Pokagon's critique to questions of environmental destruction, political sovereignty, and gendered experiences of colonialism. This class asks: What is an Indigenous book? We will learn and practice methods for reading materiality (what is paper made of?) and process (who printed the books? Prepared the pages? Circulated them for sale?). In doing so, we will examine how Indigenous writers and artists experiment with the materials of bookmaking to make the book form part of its meaning. We will examine how critically questioning the book form can decenter individual authors; raise questions about many people who participated in making, circulating, reading, and keeping books; and orient us to the trees and plants out of which books are made. This is an experimental, hands-on course where we will not only learn methods for making books but practice them as well.

We support our studies with reading exercises and \"imitation\" assignments, in which students convert close reading into fodder for original writing. Students will write at least four papers and will write, workshop and revise four poems during the Fall term. They also will lead presentations on one chosen poet and one classmate during workshop.

Finally, in the Spring term, students will focus entirely on their own work, drafting, revising, workshopping and completing one long poem of at least 120 lines that combines autobiographical material with writing from research. Throughout the year, our close reading assignments hone skills in sensitive and critical thinking; our imitation poems challenge existing habits as they introduce new strategies; our Daily Poems exercise agility and confidence; and our workshops cultivate the openness and humility necessary to serious writing and lifelong learning.

Some scholars have even argued that games are replacing novels and film as the dominant form of cultural expression. Others view games as a frivolous and unproductive activity, not worthy of serious study. In this seminar, we will explore some of the fundamental questions about the relationship between games and human culture. Why do people play games? What kinds of meanings, cultural values and political agendas do games encode? Do games function differently than other cultural objects, such as films, novels or works of art? What might it mean to think of all culture and works of art as arising from a \"play impulse\"? And if this is the case, why do we trivialize game-playing? Is the ubiquity of games in our lives a specifically modern phenomenon? Is the advent of the digital age producing a gamification of everyday life? To investigate these questions, we will read a wide range of critical writing about the importance of play and games in human culture, by philosophers, novelists, literary critics, social scientists, historians and game designers.

The text poses numerous interpretative puzzles—the myriad objects of the poem's irony, the cultural politics of its author, the \"identities\" of its characters, and the demographics and ideologies of its intended audiences, to name a few—puzzles that have been \"solved\" in strikingly different ways at different historical moments. This course takes as its subject the Canterbury Tales and its reception history, exploring of both the poem's multiple interpretative contexts and the hermeneutic conundrums it poses to them. As we read the Tales, we will consider the narratives (and narrative conventions) that Chaucer translates and transforms and the contemporary voices with whom he is in dialogue—both in the fourteenth century and the twenty-first. We will investigate the ways in which the tales circulated both individually and as a collection (which tales were the most popular? how and by whom were they published? with which other texts did they travel?) and analyze the various paratexts that accompanied them (glosses, prologues, illustrations, and \"spurious\" links and tales). Alongside this early publication context, we will explore current conversations in Chaucer criticism and the scholarly history and contemporary publics debates to which it responds. Analyzing the Tales through a wide array of methodological lenses, we will use Chaucer's experimental poem as methodological and interpretative testing ground, placing its multivalent narratives in dialogue with feminist and queer theory, critical race studies, disability studies, animal studies, and the Global Middle Ages, in addition to new and old materialities and historicisms. Seminar members are encouraged to treat the course as an interpretative lab, bringing their own methodological interests and questions to bear on the Tales in both seminar discussion and their final projects."]]}]},{"i":"001871","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in Contemporary Literature","u":"ENGLISH","n":"461-0","s":[{"i":"001871-20","r":[{"n":"Christine Froula"}],"t":"Studies in Contemporary Literature","k":"Global Modernisms","u":"ENGLISH","n":"461-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":12,"p":[["Overview of class","Our seminar will explore aspects of twentieth-century literary modernism, homing in on influential aesthetic, scholarly, and critical texts and their border-crossing receptions, including linguistic, transhistorical, and cultural translations into and out of English.

Participants will develop skills of close reading for racial formation as a formal feature of textual composition as well as gain proficiency with central and emergent debates within Ethnic American literary studies regarding the relationship between politics and aesthetics. Some conceptual questions for consideration include the following: how do experimental texts by writers of color destabilize conventional modes of understanding ethnic and racial representation? What tensions and resonances arise when critical race and ethnic studies meet theories of the avant-garde?

Still, queer theory and queer cinema faced similar skepticisms: did their ornate language and conceptual novelty endow dissident sexualities with newfound political and cultural stature, or did they retreat too far from popular accessibility and ongoing public emergencies? Was the lack of fixed definitions, communal appeals, uniting goals, or shared aesthetic practices a boon or a harm in sustaining a long-term movement of art, action, or thought?

Shakespeare's Environmental Questions This seminar will work across Shakespeare's genres (comedies, tragedies, and tragicomic hybrids), focusing on representative plays that also show a preoccupation with humanity's cosmic place and environmental situation. The course will explore Shakespeare's persistently troubled sense that humankind, alone, does not quite \"belong\" to nature. We'll assess how his understanding of \"Nature\" and our relation to it changes over his career and also how it varies in the distinct ecologies of tragedy and comedy. The critical concept of Shakespearean \"green worlds\" first arose to describe those retreats into nature (and away from civilized society) that typically occur in the comedies. There, a removal to the \"green world\" serves to counteract one or another social ill, which in turn enables a rebalanced, healthier socio-political life to be restored. But how does this traditional and sometimes pastoral sense of a natural equilibrium hold up against a closer reading of the plays, especially if we consider comedies and tragedies together? Against what, exactly, is the human order of civil life defined and established, and from what threatening \"laws of nature\" is it supposed to defend us? How does our grasp of more contemporary human impacts on the environment illuminate Shakespeare's premodern vision of human existence as a calamity of exposure -- to hard weather and our own worst instincts, too? This inquiry into Shakespeare's environmental vision will, finally, tell us something about the history of what it has meant to be human."],["Class Materials (Required)","Readings will be chosen from among Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona, A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, Cymbeline, and The Winter's Tale; brief contextual readings in early modern natural history, theology, and political thought will be supplied by the instructor."]]}]},{"i":"016641","c":"WCAS","t":"The Health of the Biosphere","u":"ENVR_SCI","n":"202-0","s":[{"i":"016641-01","r":[{"n":"Joseph S Walsh","p":"847/491-5098","a":"Hogan Hall, Room 6-110A","o":"TBA"}],"t":"The Health of the Biosphere","u":"ENVR_SCI","n":"202-0","s":"01","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute L251"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":50,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Pre-requisite: Students must have completed at least three units of Math, Chemistry, Physics, Statistics, Environmental Sciences, Earth & Planetary Sciences, or Biological Sciences.","p":[["Overview of class","This course studies the growth of populations and their interactions in ecological communities.

Making Revolution in France and its Colonies How did France become a secular republic whereas it began as a divine-right monarchy? What did it take to dismantle centuries of tradition, social hierarchy, and ways of thinking and speaking, almost overnight? In this course, we examine the role of ideas, culture, and language in the revolutionary struggles that dramatically reshaped France and the Francophone world at the end of the eighteenth century. The French Revolution drew on a powerful new understanding of \"man\" in order to reinvent or throw out entirely age-old notions of political authority, religion, the nation, the family, and the constitution. Essential to the movement's contagious force and utopianism were the writings, speeches, symbols, songs, and spectacles that made it a cultural revolution as much as a political one rooted in violence. Beginning with an exploration of influential Enlightenment ideas about human freedom and equality, we survey the revolution's most significant cultural inventions and transformations— from the emergence of a free press to the reconstitution of calendar time— with an aim toward examining their political and artistic aims. Attending to the paradoxes of revolutionary ideas and practices, we compare the revolution's claims in France with those of the anti-slavery Haitian Revolution, which in many ways exceeded the radicalism of the Parisian movement. Throughout the course, we ask in what sense culture is political, what is the relationship between culture, art, and violence, and what are the lessons of the French and Haitian Revolutions for our world today.

Drawing on case studies of policy makers, government officials, insurance agents, health care workers, and aid recipients, the course asks: what politics inform which issues become prioritized or codified in global health and development policy, and which do not? How do philosophies and values about \"good governance,\" \"best practices,\" \"preparedness,\" or \"economic progress\" influence the kinds of policies that are envisioned and/or implemented? How do politics affect global health or medical system governance, and to what effect on the ground?

For more than five-hundred years the legend of Faust has served as a way of expressing the danger of pursuing an aspiration to the point of losing one's own selfhood. The specter of a \"Faustian bargain\" appears whenever an inordinate achievement seems to arise from a destructive or self-destructive source. The theme of Faust thus provides a series of perspectives through which one can begin to reflect on one's highest values. Dr. Faustus has undergone many mutations since he first appeared in central Europe around the early sixteenth century. This class will begin with a question at the foundation of the Faust legend: what is a \"soul,\" and what is worth? While examining these and kindred questions about the nature of the self, the class will continually reflect on what we are doing when we evaluate a work of art in relation to the culture of its historical period. We begin by examining the earliest versions of Faust, which derives from the earliest days of the Protestant Reformation. We proceed to read Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's world-renowned drama involving the desire for cosmic knowledge and the lures of sexual intoxication (\"Faust, Part I\"), followed by its strange sequel (\"Faust, Part II\"), which culminates in Faust becoming a social reformer who wants to alter the very organizing of the earth. We will ask what Goethe, near the end of his life, gave to \"world literature\" (a term of his own invention) when he presented his final version of Faust as a man committed to a total terrestrial transformation. And in the final weeks of the class, we turn to Hollywood film, so that we can re-evaluate the Faust legend from the perspective of a modern medium in our own historical period, concluding with Danny Boyle's \"Yesterday\" and Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie.\""],["Registration Requirements","No requirements; taught in English; all readings in English"],["Learning Objectives","•\tTo gain a knowledge of a major legend of modern culture\n•\tTo gain an understanding of central European cultural history particular attention to the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and Romanticism. •\tTo develop and expand the skills necessary for writing a critical essay on a complex literary work.\n•\tTo gain a familiarity with the difference between analyzing a literary work and cinematic one."],["Teaching Method","Lecture"],["Evaluation Method","Class participation\nPapers Final Exam - Take Home"],["Class Materials (Required)","Texts and films will be available via Canvas"]],"o":"765","f":"56"},{"i":"001981-2","t":"The Theme of Faust Through the Ages","u":"GERMAN","n":"232-0","s":"2","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-329"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"DIS","o":"765","f":"56"},{"i":"001981-3","t":"The Theme of Faust Through the Ages","u":"GERMAN","n":"232-0","s":"3","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"DIS","o":"765","f":"56"}]},{"i":"019563","c":"WCAS","t":"Luther and the West","u":"GERMAN","n":"272-0","s":[{"i":"019563-1","r":[{"n":"Christine M Helmer","p":"847/491-2616","a":"Kresge Hall #3341","o":"Wed 2-4 pm on zoom"}],"t":"Luther and the West","u":"GERMAN","n":"272-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["555 Clark B03"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":25,"o":"475","f":"5"},{"i":"019563-2","t":"Luther and the West","u":"GERMAN","n":"272-0","s":"2","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-339"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"DIS","o":"475","f":"5"},{"i":"019563-3","t":"Luther and the West","u":"GERMAN","n":"272-0","s":"3","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 4-410"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"DIS","o":"475","f":"5"},{"i":"019563-4","t":"Luther and the West","u":"GERMAN","n":"272-0","s":"4","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 4-410"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"DIS","o":"475","f":"5"}]},{"i":"001998","c":"WCAS","t":"The German Market and the Globalized Economy","u":"GERMAN","n":"309-1","s":[{"i":"001998-2","r":[{"n":"Robert Gary Ryder","p":"847/491-8295","a":"Kresge 3-327"}],"t":"The German Market and the Globalized Economy","u":"GERMAN","n":"309-1","s":"2","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge 3354 German Seminar Rm."],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","This course will give you an overview of the German economy, its underlying structures, its current trends and some of the political and global issues it is facing today.

Numerous historians of the period have challenged us to reconsider this claim, which elides \"feminism's deeply questioning, queer, coalitional and anti-imperialist past\" and risks missing \"some ways that feminist, lesbian, and queer of color and trans activists grappled hard to develop critical insights and knowledges that move us today\" (Enke 2018).

We then turn to recent histories of the \"second wave,\" coupled with oral histories from movement participants, that challenge us to reconsider what counts as \"feminist politics\" during this period. For example, histories that focus on the formation of broad-based coalitions across and between liberation movements around issues of economic justice, reproductive rights, and the right to \"self-defense\" against both interpersonal and state violence during this period, challenge us to expand our conception of feminist activism. In the process, they require us to incorporate the \"critical insights and knowledges\" of labor and welfare rights activists, sex workers and gay liberationists, Black, Chicana, Puerto Rican and Indigenous liberation movement members as central to the feminist politics of the period. Guided student research into ongoing/current feminist projects (e.g. SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, Chicago Abortion Fund, Survived&Punished, Critical Resistance, Sylvia Rivera Law Project) aid us in identifying the legacies of this historical period in feminist activism in 2023."]],"o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"017806","c":"WCAS","t":"Sociology of Gender and Sexuality","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"331-0","s":[{"i":"017806-20","r":[{"n":"Rebecca Rose Ewert"}],"t":"Sociology of Gender and Sexuality","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"331-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":48,"p":[["Overview of class","This course is an opportunity for students to critically examine what is often a taken-for-granted aspect of social life: gender.

Both saw themselves as extending but also complicating the intellectual, aesthetic, and ideological parameters of prior formations like \"gay and lesbian studies\" or \"LGBT film.\" These new and spreading discourses stoked each other's productive advances, as scholars developed new axioms by reference to the movies, and filmmakers rooted styles and images in changing notions of gender performativity and counter-historiography. Still, queer theory and queer cinema faced similar skepticisms: did their ornate language and conceptual novelty endow dissident sexualities with newfound political and cultural stature, or did they retreat too far from popular accessibility and ongoing public emergencies? Was the lack of fixed definitions, communal appeals, uniting goals, or shared aesthetic practices a boon or a harm in sustaining a long-term movement of art, action, or thought? And how many thinkers, writers, artists, scholars, and activists were erased or marginalized by a \"queer turn\" that purported to elevate them? This class honors but also decenters this peak period in the reclaiming of \"queer.\" We will recover scholarly and cinematic trends that laid fertile grounds for that work and will also track subsequent trajectories and debates around \"queer\" in the way we perform readings, perceive bodies, record histories, spin narratives, form alliances, enter archives, and orient ourselves in space and time. Diversities of race, gender identity, nation, class, and political project will inflect our understandings of \"queer\" and even challenge the presumed primacy of sexuality as its key referent. Meanwhile, participants will develop skills of close-reading films and engage nimbly with the overarching claims but also the nuances, anomalies, and paradoxes in the scholarship we read. * Please note that this course satisfies the Queer Theory requirement for the Graduate Certificate in GSS."]]},{"i":"015741-22","r":[{"n":"Marquis Bey West"}],"t":"Topics in Gender and Sexuality Studies","k":"Theorizing Black Genders & Sexualities","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"490-0","s":"22","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 215"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","In this course, we will not be talking, simply or exclusively, about black women, or black queer (often meaning \"gay or lesbian\") people, or black transgender people; we will not be talking, simply or exclusively, about \"masculinity\" and \"femininity\" or \"sex\" as a regime of reproductive coercion sutured to certain anatomical interpretations.

At the course's foundation lies a hypothesis: the practice of imprisoning masses of people for extended periods of time is both a product of the modern state and a constituent element of the modern era. Every modern state has its own prison system to remove those it deems criminal from society. Over the past two centuries numerous regimes have resorted to detention camps in one form or another: to confine allegedly rebellious peoples, feared minorities, enemy soldiers, or stateless refugees. With varying degrees of brutality and murderous intent - a critical consideration the course will always keep in mind - those in power have used prisons and camps to suppress racial, religious, political, and other identified groups, and to exploit their labor for public and private use. Authorities have mandated that the condemned toil in confinement to pay a debt to society and for their own rehabilitation.

While we will explore primarily the experience of the Jews, we will also consider other victim categories (such as the Roma and Sinti, Slavs, gay men and lesbians, disabled persons, and Jehovah's Witnesses) and the actions of perpetrators and their local collaborators, rescuers, resistors, and bystanders. In the last part of our course we will scrutinize the legacies of the Holocaust during the first postwar years, including the survivors' struggles to rebuild their lives, criminal justice, and restitution and reparations.

The Partition created more than just the two rival nation-states of India and Pakistan from what used to be British India. It also generated a long shadow that continues to define ongoing regional conflicts such as those in Kashmir, continual anxieties about majoritarian and minoritarian identity politics viewed alternately with dread and jubilation in both India and Pakistan, and a persistent desire among South Asian creative artists to make sense of the pain of this violent event. How did the Partition come about? How have scholars, commentators, filmmakers, novelists, creative writers, and those who survived the violence of this event understood and narrativized it? Why does an event that occurred seventy-five years ago loom so large in the collective memory of South Asians today? To address these and other questions, this seminar will be divided into two parts, each based on a selected set of textual and visual materials. Part I will explore the long and complicated historiography of Partition, i.e., how Indian and Pakistani officials, historians, and scholars have written about Partition between the 1950s and contemporary times. Here we will read early accounts explaining how and why the Partition happened, in addition to exploring official narratives of Britain, India, and Pakistan about this event. Part II will focus on how Partition has been remembered beyond scholarly circles by filmmakers, novelists, and documentarians.

The imprecision with which the term is deployed leads to broad disagreements about the nature and scope of the phenomenon: Is it anti-Semitic to call a Jewish person a pig? To advocate for boycotts against the State of Israel? To work to criminalize infant circumcision, or kosher slaughter? To accuse George Soros of bankrolling BLM protests, or of conspiring to \"steal\" the presidential election? What kinds of critiques of Jews or of Judaism are fair game, and which cross the line into hate speech, or foment violence? More broadly, is anti-Semitism a form of racism? Of xenophobia? Of anti-religious animus, akin to Islamophobia? Is it a conspiracy theory? Does anti-Semitism assume that Jews constitute a religion? A nationality? An ethnicity? A \"race\"? One reason these questions are so hotly contested is because they are usually discussed ahistorically, in isolation from the extensive academic scholarship on the origins and development of anti-Semitism—both the actual phenomenon and the descriptive term itself. This course traces the historical trajectory of anti-Jewish rhetoric, violence, and discrimination from antiquity through the present. We will pay particular attention to the analytical concepts that historians have developed and deployed—including, but not limited to anti-Semitism, antisemitism, anti-Judaism, and Judeophobia. Rather than seeking to isolate an overarching definition of what is and is not anti-Semitic, we will explore the specific contexts in which anti-Jewish animus and violence developed, and the constantly evolving role \"Jews\" (as individuals and as a category) have played at key historical junctures."],["Learning Objectives","Understanding the history and historiography of \"anti-Semitism\"; comparing the diverse methods historians have used to make sense of anti-Jewish animus and violence"],["Evaluation Method","Papers, final presentation"],["Class Materials (Required)","Readings will be available in pdf format via Canvas"],["Class Notes","History Area of Concentration: Americas, European, Asia/Middle East"]],"o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"020133-36","r":[{"n":"Jeffrey Eric Eden","p":"847/491-7448"}],"t":"Approaches to History","k":"Soviet History Through Film","u":"HISTORY","n":"393-0","s":"36","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 312"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","The story of Soviet cinema is one of the most remarkable artistic \"underdog\" tales of modern times: in a country where freedom of expression was severely curtailed, Soviet filmmakers found ways to craft some of the greatest films ever made.

First, there is the context of European colonial expansion in Asia and Africa during the 19th and early 20th centuries — a formative stage for the emergence of a modern scholarly idiom about places like Egypt, India, and \"The Orient\" generally, much of which would have been inherited by an archaeologist (even a fictional one) like Jones. Secondly the 1930s, the timeframe of the films themselves, when British and French colonial power was on the wane, Nazi Germany was on the rise, and America was on the cusp of its own emergence as a global \"superpower\" in the wake of World War II. In this latter contest for global supremacy, too, the nexus between geopolitical power and scholarly knowledge loomed large, both in real life and in the Jones films. And yet one also has to remember that the films' idealization of Jones and the 1930s actually emerges from a nostalgic, late Cold War vantage point. Thus our third historical frame of reference — basically, from the 1980s to the present — will force us to examine the earlier legacies of Western power and knowledge from our own perspective, as they are refracted in the films, and as they have been re-imagined and redeployed in the present-day American political and cultural imagination."],["Learning Objectives","Improve our research and writing skills; improve our ability to think critically about historical narratives, how they are constructed, and how they contribute to popular stereotypes about the non-Western world"],["Evaluation Method","Short essays during the quarter; final research paper; class participation"],["Class Notes","Concentration: Americas, European, Asia/Middle East"]],"o":"4"},{"i":"002149-26","r":[{"n":"Robin Duffin Bates","p":"847/467-4839","a":"Harris 242"}],"t":"Research Seminar","k":"The Historian's Craft 2","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":"26","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall 108"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Freshmen may not register for this course.","p":[["Overview of class","This is the second half of a two-quarter, application-only seminar that introduces students to the scholarly practices of the discipline of history.

Open to historians and non-historians, this course reviews works that use historical methods to uncover US histories of people of African descent as they confronted various structures of racial inequity after emancipation. In this graduate research seminar, students will examine many of the most salient historical questions and scholarly interventions that have shaped the field of modern African American history in recent years.

What is the current state of the field, an inherently comparative, transnational, transcultural, and oceanic approach to the past? In what ways is the scholarship most persuasive? What insights and analytical frameworks can scholars of Latin America, Africa, Europe, or the United States glean from this recent turn in Atlantic history? Seminar participants will read examples of this scholarship, with an eye toward prevailing trends, methodologies, and topics, as well as ongoing debates about chronology, scope, and concepts—e.g., region, empire, nation, subject, citizen, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, commodity, ecosystem, sovereignty, and revolution."],["Learning Objectives","This course is designed to further our study and understanding of the historiography of the Atlantic.

Moving beyond conventional US-centric narratives, this course pushes the boundaries of the term \"America\" to incorporate territories such as Hawaii and other Pacific regions, challenging the settler colonial notion of American territoriality. Throughout the course, we will critically interrogate Eurocentric constructs of \"America\" and the implications these have on erasing and marginalizing Indigenous histories and perspectives. Key themes encompassed in the seminar include the historical and contemporary impacts of European colonization on Indigenous communities, the myriad strategies of Indigenous resistance ranging from political activism and armed struggle to cultural revitalization, and the intersections of gender, sexuality, and race within these resistance movements. Beyond the politics of resistance, students will also gain insights into Indigenous epistemologies, worldviews, and the co-constitution of colonial and Indigenous identities. This course welcomes graduate students from all disciplines."],["Learning Objectives","Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: Historical Overview: Trace the history of Indigenous resistance movements in North America from the 17th century to the present, highlighting pivotal moments, figures, and events. Geographical Broadening: Challenge and reframe US-centric perspectives of \"America\" by incorporating narratives from territories such as Hawaii and other Pacific regions. Critical Interrogation: Deconstruct and question Eurocentric constructs of \"America\" and analyze the implications these constructs have had on the erasure and marginalization of Indigenous histories and perspectives. Colonial Impacts: Recognize and articulate the multifaceted impacts, both historical and contemporary, of European colonization on Indigenous communities in North America. Strategies of Resistance: Understand and evaluate the diverse strategies employed by Indigenous communities in their resistance to colonial oppression, ranging from political activism and armed struggle to cultural revitalization. Intersectional Analysis: Examine the intersections of gender, sexuality, and race within Indigenous resistance movements and understand the complex socio-political dynamics at play. Indigenous Epistemologies: Gain a foundational understanding of Indigenous worldviews, epistemologies, and philosophies, and appreciate their significance in the context of anti-colonial resistance. Identity and Colonialism: Analyze the co-constitution of colonial and Indigenous identities and the intricate relationship between oppressor and oppressed. Multidisciplinary Engagement: Engage with and apply insights from a range of academic disciplines to the study of Indigenous resistance movements, fostering an interdisciplinary understanding."],["Evaluation Method","Participation in seminar discussions, weekly reflections, and a final research paper"]]}]},{"i":"002205","c":"WCAS","t":"Research Seminar in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"570-1","s":[{"i":"002205-22","r":[{"n":"Kathleen C Belew","p":"847/467-2305","a":"Harris Hall 242"}],"t":"Research Seminar in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"570-1","s":"22","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall 108"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":15}]},{"i":"002208","c":"WCAS","t":"Directed Research in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"580-2","s":[{"i":"002208-01","r":[{"n":"Kenneth L Alder","p":"847/467-4038","a":"Harris Hall 307"}],"t":"Directed Research in History","u":"HISTORY","n":"580-2","s":"01","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"IND","a":10},{"i":"002208-02","r":[{"n":"Michael J.

Archaeology offers nationalist agendas the possibility of filling in national historical records and extending the past far into prehistory. Its results can be displayed in museums, occupy entire sites, and be readily accessible online—thus potentially reaching many new audiences beyond traditional print media. In turn, nationalism has contributed significantly to the development of archaeology as a modern discipline that emerged largely within colonial contexts deeply embedded in imperial motivations and problematic theories around race. More recently, the growth and influence of global heritage and institutions such as UNESCO's World Heritage Centre have reshaped the political and cultural landscape of archaeological sites conceptualized as loci of national identity and pride, while introducing new tensions around equitable access to its resources and the often contradictory political and economic benefits of increased tourism. Drawing on new critical approaches and case studies selected from a wide geographical range, this course explores the role of archaeology in the creation and elaboration of national identities from the late eighteenth century to the present day. It emphasizes the identification of historical and archaeological sources and their critical evaluation. Issues include the professionalization of archaeology and its institutionalization in universities and antiquities services; the development of national museums and associated practices of display and interpretation; the creation and maintenance of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations; cultural property legislation and controversies over the repatriation of artifacts, often those removed during the era of colonial rule; and the special role of archaeology and monuments in cultural politics under totalitarian regimes."],["Learning Objectives","Learning Objectives: Historical Studies •\tAcquire knowledge of the role of archaeology and ancient history in exploring and fashioning new notions of collective identity in the modern nation-state from the late 18th century to the present •\tUnderstand how imperial and colonial administrations helped shape archaeology as a discipline and promote its prominence in academic and other institutional settings (such as museums, antiquities services, and cultural heritage organizations) •\tLearn to evaluate historical sources relevant to the political, cultural, and institutional developments that accompanied and followed the introduction of archaeological investigations in the service of national agendas •\tExpress the results of historical investigation in different modalities: engage in scholarly conversations, through reading and writing, with published scholarly work Learning Objectives: Global Perspectives on Power, Justice, and Equity •\tUnderstand the history of international agreements and institutional structures governing cultural heritage and the ways in which they also shape national practices around archaeological research and the development and presentation of archaeological sites as national cultural and economic resources •\tLearn about current debates involving repatriation and restitution of cultural property and the range of challenges they present (including legal, ethical, and sustainability issues)"],["Teaching Method","Lecture and group discussion."],["Evaluation Method","Reading responses, short papers, class discussion and presentation."],["Class Materials (Required)","Required readings will be available on CANVAS."]],"o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"021598","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in the Humanities","u":"HUM","n":"370-4","s":[{"i":"021598-23","r":[{"n":"David Shyovitz","p":"847/467-1967","a":"Harris Hall - Room 314"}],"t":"Special Topics in the Humanities","k":"What is Antisemitism?","u":"HUM","n":"370-4","s":"23","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 4770"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","In modern political discourse, \"anti-Semitism\" is frequently invoked and infrequently defined. The imprecision with which the term is deployed leads to broad disagreements about the nature and scope of the phenomenon: Is it anti-Semitic to call a Jewish person a pig? To advocate for boycotts against the State of Israel? To work to criminalize infant circumcision, or kosher slaughter? To accuse George Soros of bankrolling BLM protests, or of conspiring to \"steal\" the presidential election? What kinds of critiques of Jews or of Judaism are fair game, and which cross the line into hate speech, or foment violence? More broadly, is anti-Semitism a form of racism? Of xenophobia? Of anti-religious animus, akin to Islamophobia? Is it a conspiracy theory? Does anti-Semitism assume that Jews constitute a religion? A nationality? An ethnicity? A \"race\"? One reason these questions are so hotly contested is because they are usually discussed ahistorically, in isolation from the extensive academic scholarship on the origins and development of anti-Semitism—both the actual phenomenon and the descriptive term itself. This course traces the historical trajectory of anti-Jewish rhetoric, violence, and discrimination from antiquity through the present. We will pay particular attention to the analytical concepts that historians have developed and deployed—including, but not limited to anti-Semitism, antisemitism, anti-Judaism, and Judeophobia. Rather than seeking to isolate an overarching definition of what is and is not anti-Semitic, we will explore the specific contexts in which anti-Jewish animus and violence developed, and the constantly evolving role \"Jews\" (as individuals and as a category) have played at key historical junctures."],["Learning Objectives","Understanding the history and historiography of \"anti-Semitism;\" comparing the diverse methods historians have used to make sense of anti-Jewish animus and violence."],["Evaluation Method","Papers, final presentation"],["Class Materials (Required)","Readings will be available in PDF format via Canvas."],["Class Notes","History Area of Concentration: Americas, European, Asia/Middle East"]],"o":"4","f":"4"}]},{"i":"021600","c":"WCAS","t":"Special Topics in the Humanities","u":"HUM","n":"370-6","s":[{"i":"021600-20","r":[{"n":"Corey Byrnes","p":"847/467-3314","a":"1880 Campus Drive, Kresge Hall, Office 4-548","o":"Varies quarter to quarter, please check with instructor."}],"t":"Special Topics in the Humanities","k":"Sinophobia, Yellow Peril, and Other Fantasies of C","u":"HUM","n":"370-6","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Kresge 4438 Asian LC Sem Rm"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":7,"p":[["Overview of class","Sinophobia, Yellow Peril, and Other Fantasies of China as Threat China has long been an object of fascination and anxiety in the Euro-American imagination. In recent decades, a politicized and racialized discourse of a \"rising\" China has constructed that nation as an existential threat to America's global hegemony. As a figure of possibility rather than probability, threat refers not to what is likely to happen but to what could conceivably happen. Threat, like risk, requires acts of the imagination, speculative fictions designed not simply to create fear but to inspire action. This course offers both a critical history of those speculative and often sensational visions of a threatening China (in literature, film, visual culture, and other media) as well as an introduction to key theoretical texts that allow us to better understand how China has been constructed as an object of imagination from the19th century to the present day.

For the past 75 years, U.S. policymakers have struggled to define America's role in an ever more complex world where threats multiply and challenges morph and endure. The period beginning with the Cold War traces an arc that reaches from nuclear arsenals to fleets of unmanned drones, from a fear of falling dominoes in Southeast Asia to a raft of conflicts in the Middle East and Europe. And, now, amid war and uncertainty, a new presidential campaign is underway. The course draws upon an engaging set of case studies and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means. As the course progresses, we will pay particular attention to the foreign policy choices of President Biden and the domestic debate about those choices. This is not a class where you are expected to produce journalism, and no prior experience with journalism or Medill is required.

Finally, we will assess the return of a documentary approach to reality in films like Garrone's Gomorra (Gomorrah, 2008) and Rosi's Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea, 2016) in the context of globalization and the resurgence of populism and right-wing politics.

And is there an actual entity of \"Israeli society\" or is it only imagined by those who seek to be part of it? Film in its nature is an introspective tool, and in the case of Israeli film it has always been a prism through which Israeli directors examine questions of identity, the treatment of \"others\", and the relationship between the center and the margins. In this class we will watch various Israeli films that relate to the notion of otherness and to the dilemmas that arise from the characters' complex position in Israeli society. Among the movies we will watch are \"Baba Joon\", \"Borrowed Identity\", \"Sandstorm\" and \"Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem\". We will read texts that will contextualize the movies and will shed light on the stance of otherness in Israeli society. No previous knowledge of Hebrew or Israel or Israeli cinema is required. All the movies will have English subtitles and all the readings will be in English, as well as the lectures and class discussions."],["Registration Requirements","None."],["Learning Objectives","- Gain knowledge about various sectors and minorities in Israeli society and the dilemmas individuals in these groups are confronted with. - Gain some knowledge on theories of Otherness in the context of Israeli society.\n- Be able to identify cinematic signifiers in given scenes such as frame composition, its size and kind (long shot, close-up, shoulder camera, point of view, etc.). - Be able to use their understanding of cinematic language to analyze scenes in movies we watched and explain how the cinematic language supports or undermines the position of a character or the film's narrative.\n- Develop a sense of empathy towards characters in different life and culture's circumstances. - Develop critical reading and thinking - Develop writing, collaboration, and interpersonal communication skills."],["Evaluation Method","Attendance & Class Participation: 20%\nReadings/Writing Assignments/Quizzes/Homework: 25%\nMid-term paper: 20%\nFinal Paper: 35%"],["Class Materials (Required)","Materials will be provided by the instructor."]],"o":"6","f":"6"}]},{"i":"002350","c":"WCAS","t":"Korean I","u":"KOREAN","n":"111-2","s":[{"i":"002350-20","r":[{"n":"Ihnhee L Kim","p":"847/491-2767","a":"1880 Campus Drive, Kresge Hall, Office 4-417","o":"Varies quarter to quarter, please check with instructor."}],"t":"Korean I","u":"KOREAN","n":"111-2","s":"20","m":["0123"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 412"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"LEC","a":16,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite: Students must have passed Korean 111-1 with at least a C- or be placed in according to placement test results.

The first part of the course will focus on the persecution of Jews during the first half of the 20th century culminating in their genocide between 1939-1945. We will discuss Nazi ideology; the complex interface between the Nazi regime's espousal of racism and the motivation of perpetrators on the ground; the interface between politics and law; the victims' reactions to persecution; conditions of life in the ghettos and camps; the response of the international community; and the aftermath of the war.

Contractarianism is a political theory that employs the idea of agreement among rational and equal persons to account for the content and the normative force of the requirements applicable to those rational and equal persons. We will explore many themes in political philosophy by looking at six philosophers who endorsed contractarianism—namely, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Rawls, Carole Pateman, and Charles Mills."],["Learning Objectives","Use the tools of philosophy (logic) to compose, analyze, and evaluate arguments.

Is there historical progress, and if so, of what sort? Is there a central defining subject matter or \"spine\" for human history (such as political events, technology, cultures)? Relatedly, we will also discuss questions - of philosophical anthropology, one might say -- that occupy these early thinkers concerning the relationship between history and nature, freedom, and rationality. For example: is human history to be understood as part of or continuous with natural history (of all organisms, or of human organisms in particular)? Is historical investigation therefore strongly akin to biological explanation, or based upon biological premises? Or does human freedom or rationality disrupt the claims of biology and nature - so that history (proper) is departure from nature, a break with (merely) biological processes? What, most broadly, makes human beings historical? Finally, we will also consider why these philosophers present their claims concerning human nature (philosophical anthropology) in speculative-historical, narrative form: what sorts of philosophical claims or projects might be promoted by this form of philosophizing? We will consider how these projects in philosophy of history may be connected to the philosophers' criticisms of the European colonial project and (related) European racist theorizing (historically contemporary to their work). We will conclude the course with excerpts from later discussions of the relation between philosophy and history, as a contrast case: Friedrich Nietzsche's debunking genealogy of morality, and Amia Srinavasan's reflections on the cogency of such genealogical arguments."],["Class Materials (Required)","Same as PHIL 401-1 Johann Gottfried Herder, Another Philosophy of History and Selected Political Writings, trans.

However, most people have great difficulty understanding infinite sets like these. Are there more positive integers than positive even integers? Are there more rational numbers than natural numbers? Are there more real numbers than rational numbers? You might be surprised at the correct answers to some of these questions. To set the stage, we'll look (informally) at some of the math background on infinity, as developed by Georg Cantor and others in the 19th Century. Then we'll examine some reasons why thinking and reasoning about infinity is so difficult.

Such narratives may be about encounters with religious authorities or special beings (angels, gods, ancestors, and so on); or about the story-teller's involvement in religious movements; or his, her, or their religious crises. Pairing personal narratives with adjacent historical sources and critical essays, we open with questions about narrative itself and end with the role of stories—as told by humans and non-humans—in the climate crisis. How do the stories people tell about religion(s) help us understand not only the tellers of these stories but also the religious and social worlds in which these stories arise and to which they refer? The questions sound straightforward enough! But personal narratives are complex things. There is the matter of the details story-tellers choose to leave in or take out; the relative emphases they place on one aspect or incident over another; even the reasons they tell the story at all, in the first place, which may be conscious or unconscious. There is always an aspect of manipulation about story-telling! Then there are questions about setting, the literal, physical circumstances in which a story is told, from prison, for instance, or in a courtroom, and so on. Finally, there is the fact that some stories and story-tellers are valued and trusted over others, for reasons having to do with power, race, gender, and social class. Behind the current controversy over public library holdings and access, for example, is the determination that certain stories—about gender transition, for instance, or about the lives of drag performers, or accounts of racial oppression or violence against women—ought not to be told. There are religious dimensions to such stories, often enough, as well as to the campaigns to censor them. In a perverse way, such efforts to prohibit certain stories underscore the unique efficacy and potency of narrative! But we need to ask ourselves what is feared, what is silenced, when a particular story is forbidden? What makes a story dangerous? What makes a religious story especially dangerous? We will read critical accounts of narrative as practice (by Audre Lorde, Simone Weil, Adriana Cavarero, Judith Butler, and others); personal narratives in various genres (including autobiography, autobiographical fiction, film, creative non-fiction and theater); and history and historical documents. Critical skills to be emphasized are close reading; critical analysis; seminar participation (creating knowledge intersubjectively); and writing in various genres.

This anniversary commemorated the day the German monk Martin Luther is said to have posted his 95 Theses on the church door in Wittenberg, Germany. The results of Luther's ideas and actions cannot be understated. His teachings led to an ongoing division between Roman Catholic and Protestant forms of Christianity and inaugurated a \"modern\" turn towards rationalism, secularism, and individualism. This course probes the lasting significance of Luther's life and thought in the modern West. Two questions will guide the course. First, how did Luther shape the cultural, political, and social questions and issues in the West since the 16th century? And, second, what is Luther's ongoing relevance in the West today?"],["Learning Objectives","Students will be able to define basic terms in the study of religion and theology (for example, subjectivity, freedom, experience).

Responding to recent calls to decenter \"the human\" within the (post)humanities and social sciences, we will investigate what gets lost by dividing meaning from materiality, the natural from the cultural, the archival and literary from the ethnographic. Troubling disciplinary boundaries and categorical binaries, students will be encouraged to explore what text and ethnography share as entangled sites of human and nonhuman production and what we stand to gain by linking them. What are the textual practices inscribed by our ethnographic fields and scholarly productions? How do we locate the sites in which textual projects emerge and include the bodies in which they come to live? Students will learn how to expand and deepen their own textual and ethnographic projects by incorporating research practices from both methods. Readings will be drawn from fields like anthropology, textual, literary and media studies, queer and trans studies, lived religion, science and technology studies, antiquity studies, history. The course will be of interest to students across these fields. Assignments will position students to integrate course readings and topics to their own research projects, to develop interdisciplinary research methods across time and modality, and to apply that knowledge toward research proposal development."]]}]},{"i":"008543","c":"WCAS","t":"Contemporary Theories of Religion","u":"RELIGION","n":"481-2","s":[{"i":"008543-20","r":[{"n":"Brannon Dobbs Ingram","a":"Crowe Hall 4-135"}],"t":"Contemporary Theories of Religion","k":"Thinking with, through, and against \"religion\"","u":"RELIGION","n":"481-2","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":30}],"l":["Crowe 4-130 Rel Studies Sem Rm"],"d":"2024-01-03","e":"2024-03-09","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","Secularities: Thinking with, through, and against \"religion\" This course will introduce graduate students to a range of approaches to theorizing the category of \"religion\" in recent interdisciplinary scholarship.

The Boom inaugurated what some critics called a \"revolutionary writing\" that not only challenged literary practices from the first half of the 20th century, but also generated a parallel boom of critical writing about Latin American literature and writers. Through critical essays, documentary films, and autobiographical accounts, we will consider the historical, political, literary, and personal factors that contributed to the Boom phenomenon, the ways in which it was viewed and represented at the time and in subsequent decades, and its role within Latin American literary and cultural history. Primary materials will include Carlos Fuentes's La muerte de Artemio Cruz (1962) and Manuel Puig's Boquitas pintadas (1969), which represent different phases of the Boom and also trends in the \"new\" narrative, and José Donoso's Historia personal del boom (1972; 1983), which presents a Boom author's behind-the-scenes version of literary events and personal relationships during the 1960s-1970s. Secondary materials will include essays by other Boom writers, filmed interviews with authors, and feature-length films (one a thematic and technical source for La muerte de Artemio Cruz and the other an adaptation of Boquitas pintadas). IN working with these materials, we will both explore the characteristics of Boom novels and develop further an ability to read and analyze literary texts in their own terms and within a variety of contexts.

The purpose of the course is threefold: first, to offer an in-depth survey of the foundational writings and authors of Brazilian literature; second, to understand, from a comparative approach, how these writers approached some of the most pressing issues of 19th-century; third, to imagine how Machado de Assis read and evaluated the novels produced at the time. Because we want to read as much fiction as we can, the class discussions will not require any secondary readings, although a list of relevant theory and criticism will be provided and may be utilized in the oral presentation, exam or research paper.
