The critique of \"Orientalism\" frames our investigation, deconstructing the categories of West and East proposed in the title of the course, learning, analyzing, accepting and challenging the established concepts of Orientalism. By combining Ethno and Musicological approaches, we can view European music as a continuing exchange between Eastern and Western cultures (Ancient Greece, the cradle of Western civilization, is not necessarily Western; troubadour songs owe their poetic metaphors to Middle Eastern bards). The geographical boundary between West and East and the concept of Orient and Occident are political and social constructions. Defining both the Occident and the Orient, Western artists, products of their cultural and political environment, created the East as a romanticized abstraction, which mirrored not Oriental but European fantasies and frustrations. Exploring the musical depiction of the East by Westerners, we will attempt to include related Eastern traditional expression as well as trying to imagine how the East might view the West. The musical collection encompasses different historical periods, musical types, genres, composers, and pieces, especially focusing on romantic operas (Madama Butterfly, L'Italiana in Algeri, Aida, and Carmen) as well as twentieth century musical culture (the Beatles, John Zorn, and John Mellencomp)."]],"o":"6"}]},{"i":"019443","c":"MUSIC","t":"Topics in Popular Music","u":"MUSICOL","n":"333-0","s":[{"i":"019443-1","r":[{"n":"Linda P Austern","p":"847/491-5705","a":"l-austern@northwestern.edu","o":"E-mail instructor to arrange a meeting."}],"t":"Topics in Popular Music","k":"Women Rock","u":"MUSICOL","n":"333-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA Lower Level 121"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":8,"p":[["Overview of class","An examination of the roles of women in rock music from the inception of the genre through today, framed by changing social expectations for women and increasing acceptance of diversity among performers and consumers.

The answer lies in a complex web of issues, based partially on the unquestionable power and aesthetic appeal of Beethoven's music, but also on concepts of genius, heroism, politics, myth, and meaning in music that were shifting in the early nineteenth century. This course aims to better understand Beethoven's music by situating it within the aesthetics of the French Revolutionary period, the genres of Classicism and the new subjectivity of the nineteenth century; probing the gestural intersections between Beethoven's vocal and untexted repertoires; mapping Beethoven's expansion of music genres; exploring important performers of Beethoven's music; understanding connections between Beethoven's music and late eighteenth-century religious philosophies; and considering performance practice from the nineteenth century to today in a global context."],["Learning Objectives","1.\tLearn examples of Beethoven's music across a breadth of genres\n2.\tEngage how historical narratives about Beethoven's music are constructed and repeated, and explore alternatives 3.\tIdentify traditions and lineages of performance practice through listening\n4.\tHone the ability to write (and talk) about Beethoven's music for distinct audiences, including writing program notes and learning acceptable German pronunciation"],["Teaching Method","Mix of lectures, group discussions, and mindful listening"],["Evaluation Method","Four written projects and one quiz, each worth 20% of the grade"],["Class Materials (Required)","All class materials are provided on Canvas or freely via electronic resources such as Naxos Library, MetOnline, MediciTV, or YouTube"],["Class Notes","Students taking this course should have some background in music history and/or performance; music literacy (ability to read a score) is necessary; reading knowledge of German is a plus but not necessary"]]}]},{"i":"003662","c":"MUSIC","t":"Senior Project","u":"MUSICOL","n":"385-0","s":[{"i":"003662-1","r":[{"n":"Linda P Austern","p":"847/491-5705","a":"l-austern@northwestern.edu","o":"E-mail instructor to arrange a meeting."}],"t":"Senior Project","u":"MUSICOL","n":"385-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":5},{"i":"003662-2","r":[{"n":"Drew Edward Davies","p":"847/467-3367","a":"dedavies@northwestern.edu","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Senior Project","u":"MUSICOL","n":"385-0","s":"2","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":5},{"i":"003662-3","r":[{"n":"Ryan Wayne Dohoney","a":"ryan.dohoney@northwestern.edu","o":"Email instructor to arrange a meeting."}],"t":"Senior Project","u":"MUSICOL","n":"385-0","s":"3","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":5},{"i":"003662-5","r":[{"n":"Scott Douglas Paulin","a":"s-paulin@northwestern.edu","o":"E-mail Instructor"}],"t":"Senior Project","u":"MUSICOL","n":"385-0","s":"5","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":5},{"i":"003662-6","r":[{"n":"Jesse Rosenberg","p":"847/467-2033","a":"j-rosenberg1@northwestern.edu","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Senior Project","u":"MUSICOL","n":"385-0","s":"6","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":5},{"i":"003662-7","r":[{"n":"Andrew J.

This is why composition handbooks of the era are full of concepts derived from grammar and rhetoric. Starting with these concepts and following the most authoritative composition handbook by Heinrich Christoph Koch, the course will guide you step-by-step from smallest musical building blocks up to entire compositions, and it will teach you how to apply concepts developed by eighteenth-century music theorists in analyses of pieces by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.

How does it inform musical meaning and emotion? What musical parameters does it concern? Is it determined by structure of these parameters? Or is it a matter of statistics? What types of knowledge does it engage? How does it relate to consciousness and memory?"],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the class you will gain understanding of mechanisms involved in musical expectation, appreciate the role of expectation in listening experience and become familiar with analytical methods that allow us to trace expectations generated by different musical parameters."],["Teaching Method","In-class analysis of selected pieces; Preparation of the final paper"],["Evaluation Method","Attendance, Class Participation, Discussion, Paper, Presentations"],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbooks required."]]}]},{"i":"024868","c":"MUSIC","t":"Technique Class - First Year","u":"PIANO","n":"102-0","s":[{"i":"024868-1","t":"Technique Class - First Year","u":"PIANO","n":"102-0","s":"1","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":20}],"l":["RCMA 3-141 Studio"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LAB","a":8}]},{"i":"003834","c":"MUSIC","t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":[{"i":"003834-1","r":[{"n":"James F Giles","p":"847/491-5733","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003834-2","r":[{"n":"Sylvia Wang","p":"847/491-3906","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":"2","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003834-3","r":[{"n":"Christopher Michael Guzman"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"161-0","s":"3","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"}]},{"i":"024869","c":"MUSIC","t":"Technique Class - Second Year","u":"PIANO","n":"202-0","s":[{"i":"024869-1","t":"Technique Class - Second Year","u":"PIANO","n":"202-0","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA 3-141 Studio"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LAB","a":12},{"i":"024869-2","t":"Technique Class - Second Year","u":"PIANO","n":"202-0","s":"2","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA 3-131"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LAB","a":12},{"i":"024869-3","r":[{"n":"Dominic Theodore Joseph Doutney"}],"t":"Technique Class - Second Year","u":"PIANO","n":"202-0","s":"3","m":["1","2"],"x":[{"h":17,"m":30},{"h":17,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":20},{"h":18,"m":20}],"l":["RCMA 3-142 Studio","RCMA Lower Level 115"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LAB","a":12}]},{"i":"003836","c":"MUSIC","t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":[{"i":"003836-1","r":[{"n":"James F Giles","p":"847/491-5733","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003836-2","r":[{"n":"Sylvia Wang","p":"847/491-3906","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":"2","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"},{"i":"003836-3","r":[{"n":"Christopher Michael Guzman"}],"t":"Applied Piano for Music Majors","u":"PIANO","n":"261-0","s":"3","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for Music Majors Only"}]},{"i":"018278","c":"MUSIC","t":"Optional Recital","u":"PIANO","n":"305-0","s":[{"i":"018278-1","r":[{"n":"James F Giles","p":"847/491-5733","a":"MAB 711 Elgin Rd, Evanston IL","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Optional Recital","u":"PIANO","n":"305-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"PED","a":20}]},{"i":"003838","c":"MUSIC","t":"Piano Repertoire I","u":"PIANO","n":"313-1","s":[{"i":"003838-1","r":[{"n":"Rodolfo Augusto Faistauer"}],"t":"Piano Repertoire I","u":"PIANO","n":"313-1","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA 3-131"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":12}]},{"i":"003841","c":"MUSIC","t":"Piano Pedagogy I","u":"PIANO","n":"315-1","s":[{"i":"003841-1","r":[{"n":"Lam Wong"}],"t":"Piano Pedagogy I","u":"PIANO","n":"315-1","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA 3-131"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":12,"p":[["Overview of class","This course is part of the full-year sequence.

The TAs and I will go from group to group listening and answering questions. Periodically we will come back together and one of the small groups will present the answer to the problem to the class.

Supreme Court decision in Miller v. Alabama (which banned mandatory life sentences for youth), students might also represent individuals in post-conviction and resentencing proceedings, who were given lengthy or life sentences for offenses that occurred when they were in their youth. They may also draft amicus briefs to state appellate and supreme courts. Students may also collaborate with statewide and national partners on research and policy initiatives related to the extreme sentencing of youth and emerging adults. Students will have the opportunity to develop traditional trial skills as well as skills related to negotiation, investigation, discovery, expert witness preparation, client counseling, written advocacy, and policy reform. Additionally, as work in this clinic intersects with national, statewide, and local activism and conversations occurring around race/structural racism, policing, and prosecution, students can expect readings and discussions exploring the structural forces and trends behind the law in this area as well as social science research regarding adolescent development, public health approaches to violence, the benefits of holistic representation, and the implementation of restorative justice practices.

For many years, CFJC students have participated in successful efforts to: close two Illinois juvenile prisons, expand expungement rights for people with juvenile records, and shorten young people's length of incarceration, parole, and probation. This semester students will develop and advocate for a statewide public defender system which ensures every indigent defendant their Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Presently, Illinois' public defense \"system\" is underfunded, over worked and chaotic as it is one of only eight states without a statewide system."]]}]},{"i":"019927","c":"LAW","t":"Clinic: Second Chances for Youth: Decarceration, Diversion and Post-Sentencing Advocacy","u":"LITARB","n":"734","s":[{"i":"019927-1","r":[{"n":"Alison R Flaum","p":"312/503-8576","a":"Bluhm Legal Clinci","o":"N/A"}],"t":"Clinic: Second Chances for Youth: Decarceration, Diversion and Post-Sentencing Advocacy","u":"LITARB","n":"734","s":"1","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":35}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff Building 887"],"d":"2023-08-21","e":"2023-11-22","c":"CLN","a":8,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"023549","c":"LAW","t":"International Litigation","u":"LITARB","n":"744","s":[{"i":"023549-1","r":[{"n":"Zachary David Clopton"}],"t":"International Litigation","u":"LITARB","n":"744","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":20}],"l":["McCormick 371"],"d":"2023-08-21","e":"2023-11-22","c":"SEM","a":20}]},{"i":"023574","c":"LAW","t":"Clinic Practice: Women and Children's Human Rights Advocacy: International and Domestic","u":"LITARB","n":"745","s":[{"i":"023574-1","r":[{"n":"Carolyn E Frazier","p":"312/503-0093","a":"Rubloff 805 / c-frazier@law.northwestern.edu","o":"By appointment"}],"t":"Clinic Practice: Women and Children's Human Rights Advocacy: International and Domestic","u":"LITARB","n":"745","s":"1","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":35}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff Building 801"],"d":"2023-08-21","e":"2023-11-22","c":"CLN","a":6}]},{"i":"023683","c":"LAW","t":"Clinic: Movement Lawyering","u":"LITARB","n":"746","s":[{"i":"023683-1","r":[{"n":"Sheila A Bedi"}],"t":"Clinic: Movement Lawyering","u":"LITARB","n":"746","s":"1","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":35}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff Building 887"],"d":"2023-08-21","e":"2023-11-22","c":"CLN","a":10}]},{"i":"007017","c":"LAW","t":"Property","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"530","s":[{"i":"007017-3","r":[{"n":"Nadav Shoked"}],"t":"Property","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"530","s":"3","m":["012"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":25}],"l":["Levy Mayer 204 - Booth Hall"],"d":"2023-08-21","e":"2023-11-22","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"},{"i":"007017-4","r":[{"n":"Peter Charles DiCola","p":"312/503-3231","a":"Levy Mayer 295","o":"TBD"}],"t":"Property","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"530","s":"4","m":["34"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":25}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff Building 140"],"d":"2023-08-21","e":"2023-11-22","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll","p":[["Overview of class","The textbook for the course is my own adaptation of CLOWNEY, GRIMMELMANN, GRYNBERG, SHEFF, & TUSHNET, OPEN-SOURCE PROPERTY: A FREE CASEBOOK (2015-2017), which I will abbreviate as \"OSP.\" All assigned readings will be made available as PDF files on Canvas.

If you do use outside study aids, you should beware of inaccurate or oversimplified sources. I generally recommend the treatise by Joseph William Singer & Nestor M. Davidson, Property (6th ed. 2022), which the organization of our course will track pretty well. I recommend a workbook by John Makdisi, Estates in Land and Future Interests: Problems and Answers (7th ed. 2017) to practice the particular topics named in that title. The volume by Burke and Snowe on Property in the Examples and Explanations series (6th ed. 2019) could also be helpful, because of its similar focus on problems and answers, but its coverage does not match what we do in the course."],["Class Notes","The course will include a practice midterm exam.

Specifically, the course focuses on the analysis of the structure and properties of soils and rocks, and the way these materials respond to loading (mechanical and hydraulic loading). The course comprises theoretical sessions, practical sessions, and laboratory sessions. The theoretical sessions develop foundational concepts, theories, and approaches underpinning the characterization, analysis, and prediction of the structure, properties, and behavior of geomaterials. The practical sessions apply the gathered theory to solve a variety of earth surface engineering problems, with an outlook on the interplay between the structure, properties, and behavior of geomaterials and the engineering performance of natural and built environments. The laboratory sessions propose and guide through hands-on activities and laboratory tests of geomaterials to address basic earth surface engineering problems."],["Learning Objectives","At the end of this course, students will be able to:\n1) Compute the properties of three-phase materials including soils\n2) Classify the properties of soils through the analysis of experimental data and the development of\nappropriate laboratory tests\n3) Calculate stresses at depth in the presence and absence of water\n4) Determine the direction and magnitude of seepage flows in soils\n5) Characterize the compression and consolidation behavior of soils through the analysis of\nexperimental data and the development of appropriate laboratory tests\n6) Characterize the shearing behavior of soils, rocks, and discontinuities through the analysis of\nexperimental data and the development of appropriate laboratory tests\n7) Relate the treated content of earth surface engineering with grand challenges in sustainability and\nresilience\n8) Communicate in oral, written, and graphical form with appropriate means\n9) Employ computer software and techniques for design and communication\n10) Work individually and in a team to solve problems related to earth surface engineering\n11) Structure and write reports summarizing the results of technical calculations and analyses"],["Teaching Method","This is arguably the first \"real\" engineering course that many students will take in the sense that problems encountered are more \"open-ended\" with a range of \"right answers\" in many instances, and they draw upon synthesizing concepts from preceding courses punctuated by an occasional need for engineering judgement.

Energy is harvested from renewable sources and transmitted along smart grids. The processes that support sustainable urban districts are linked and managed through a \"cen­tral nervous\" or information system, which optimizes resource recovery and maximizes profitability through integration, monitoring, communication and accurate pricing. Sustainable urban development is place-based, reflecting regional conditions and local culture. Sustainable urban districts are walkable and bikeable, diminishing the need for private automobiles, and they are ecologi­cally regenerative, economically vibrant and socially equitable."],["Registration Requirements","Instructor Permission Required\nCIV-ENV 386 Required\nCIV-ENV 385, 1, 2 & 3 recommended"],["Class Materials (Required)","Drawing Materials:\n- Sign Pen Package\n- Engineer Scale\n- Tracking paper (roll)"],["Class Materials (Suggested)","Optional:\n- Drafting dots\n- Tracing Paper (14x17 pad)\n-Highlighter pack"]]}]},{"i":"004855","c":"MEAS","t":"Mechanics of Continua 1","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"417-1","s":[{"i":"004855-20","r":[{"n":"John W Rudnicki","p":"847/491-3411","a":"Technological Institute, Rm A128, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS","o":"jwrudn@northwestern.edu"}],"t":"Mechanics of Continua 1","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"417-1","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute MG28"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":30}]},{"i":"004865","c":"MEAS","t":"Prestressed Concrete Design","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"421-0","s":[{"i":"004865-1","r":[{"n":"Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming","p":"847/491-1392","a":"Tech A220","o":"By Appointment"}],"t":"Prestressed Concrete Design","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"421-0","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute LG52"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":35}]},{"i":"004863","c":"MEAS","t":"Matrix Analysis of Structures","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"423-0","s":[{"i":"004863-1","r":[{"n":"Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming","p":"847/491-1392","a":"Tech A220","o":"By Appointment"}],"t":"Matrix Analysis of Structures","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"423-0","s":"1","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute M166"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":20}]},{"i":"024445","c":"MEAS","t":"Structural Design I","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"428-1","s":[{"i":"024445-1","r":[{"n":"Gianluca Cusatis","a":"2145 N.

Part one of the course establishes the metrics needed to evaluate Marketing as a function of a firm. These skills are essential for budgeting, estimating Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI), setting pricing strategy, making channel decisions etc. Being able to prioritize the metrics of a firm and communicate how Marketing adds value is critical to being an effective Marketing leader. Part two of the course explores metrics as a way to optimizing Marketing Communications. As a foundation, students will understand the types of data needed to measure customer loyalty, predict customer value and manage the owned, earned and paid media that reaches them. Students are expected to analyze marketing campaign results, as well as communicate their findings as it relates to business outcomes, whether over email, in a presentation or visualizing metrics in a dashboard. Finally, part three of the course is about the metrics needed to support Marketing as a science. Topics covered extend the knowledge of experimentation with the goal of being able to establish a Center of Excellence (COE) around innovation and testing. Students will be expected to apply these learnings as they optimize Marketing plans and measure results against them. Class sessions will consist of readings, online discussions and active learning.

It's designed to provide an overview of the domain for graduate students who aim to report on, write for, edit in, or curate for magazines broadly defined (print, online, or both). The course is intended as a magazine-inflected complement to the other major course of the term -- reporting and revising in your project-based learning class during the first quarter. Our work together is primarily based on reading, viewing, and analysis of major magazine titles - legacy as well as newcomers - to explore the fundamental qualities of strong narratives. No matter what role you envision for yourself in media, our work will be relevant. Is it your ambition to create new knowledge through writing journalistic pieces for existing outlets? Or to edit, curate, produce, or otherwise serve as a team leader on investigative projects? Or to become an entrepreneur launching something brand new? This is the place to consider the heart of the matter - the power of diverse story forms for different purposes - and to deepen your understanding of them as you prepare yourself for a year-long exploration of your own talents. Every person involved in the creation of meaningful journalism, after all, should be literate in key elements of compelling journalism. The course is designed, in particular, for students who will move in the next three quarters of study to magazine presentation, digital media, magazine editing, and feature writing. For students who intend to finish up in the Narrative Capstone, here's the first step on that pathway. Each week we'll sink deeply into the editorial architecture of a particular magazine outlet. We'll regularly hear directly from writers and editors, in person and via Zoom or Skype. We'll build towards a broad view of what's currently happening in the domain, helping each student clarify where s/he would like to put her effort during the year.

And the consent of the governed regarding public policy and policymakers is informed by a free and responsible press. But what happens when this process is distorted by a disinformation campaign set in motion by government elites who attempt to engineer public consent? What is the role of the news media in reporting the news, assessing it, critiquing it, contextualizing it in contributing to enlightened public decision making? How might the conventions of journalism—the traditional rules and practices that guide our work—be used against the objectives of journalism? Through assigned readings and robust discussion, this seminar will explore the dynamics of public opinion and attempts to manipulate it. Against the backdrop of media coverage of current events, we will come to understand the framework for propaganda, its elements, how it works and how it has been used in the construction and reinforcement of social difference. Ultimately, we will see how this process has been weaponized—pitting identifiable groups against each other—in the process of assuming and maintaining political power. In this process, we will see how the term \"fake news\" has been used in an effort to undermine media credibility and cause public confusion about what to believe. Ironically, and unsurprisingly, we will see that the very people charging \"fake news\" are the ones generating it. In the end, we must consider our role as journalists in this process. How have we been complicit? What is our responsibility to ensure a deeper public appreciation of the value of social difference? What is the public responsibility in achieving a degree of literacy, particularly with increasing reliance on social media?

Students will look at the Future as imagined by the Gulf city-state, examining conceptions of modernity, belonging, transience, and citizenship. They will also explore the relationship of humans to technology, and the possibilities it presents in shaping alternative identities and realities. The course uses Futures ‘games' and role-playing as a learning method to help practice ‘speculative futuring' by engaging students to ‘game out' possibilities for the future. The goal of this course is to encourage students to think about the ‘far-off future' intellectually, and to engage with futurist thinking as a practical skill that can create tangible change in their surrounding communities as well as in their own personal life.</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <li>Open for Cross-Registration</li>\n</ul>"]]}]},{"i":"024959","c":"DOHA","t":"Identity Narrative & Diplomacy","u":"INTERDIS","n":"309-0","s":[{"i":"024959-70","r":[{"n":"Nadine Ghamloush"}],"t":"Identity Narrative & Diplomacy","u":"INTERDIS","n":"309-0","s":"70","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 2-257"],"d":"2023-08-20","e":"2023-11-30","c":"LEC","a":23,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for sophomore, juniors, and seniors only.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>Communication is central to how we understand international affairs.

Therefore, artfully crafted sound design is a vital component of effective audio-visual media.

The course adopts a holistic approach to the study of refugees grounded largely on peopled perspectives, and drawing upon sociological, ethnographic, and historical material. Less focused on causes of refugee movements, we will look into the meanings of displacement through refugees' experiences, how they adapt to their new situations and find ways to overcome challenges, how local and international organizations and communities respond to refugee influxes in short-term and protracted situations, and how different media and formats represent refugees and issues. Students will be exposed to the work of anthropologists, sociologists, historians, journalists, aid workers, policy makers, literary authors/artists, and voices of refugees themselves. This insight will equip future communicators and journalists with knowledge of issues and formats to engage in meaningful work around refugees.</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <li>Open for cross-registration</li>\n<li>Satisfies Middle East Studies Minor and Media and Politics Minor</li>\n</ul>"]]}]},{"i":"021958","c":"DOHA","t":"Introduction to Strategic Communication","u":"STRATCOM","n":"303-0","s":[{"i":"021958-70","r":[{"n":"Denise Yammine Yammine"}],"t":"Introduction to Strategic Communication","u":"STRATCOM","n":"303-0","s":"70","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":1,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room G-200"],"d":"2023-08-20","e":"2023-11-30","c":"LEC","a":35,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for sophomore, juniors, and seniors only.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>Introductory course in which students learn about the fundamentals of strategic communication; become familiar with strategic communication practices such as advertising, public relations, branding, corporate communication, promotions, social media marketing, and mobile marketing; understand the integrated approach to IMC (Integrated Marketing Communications); explore issues shaping the practice of strategic communication such as ethics and industry regulations; discover career opportunities and types of jobs in strategic marketing communications in the non-profit sector, the private sector, or the government.</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li>Open to sophomores and above</li>\n<li>Satisfies Strategic Communication Minor</li>\n</ul>"]]}]},{"i":"019337","c":"DOHA","t":"Corporate Storytelling","u":"STRATCOM","n":"305-0","s":[{"i":"019337-70","r":[{"n":"Matthias Krug"}],"t":"Corporate Storytelling","u":"STRATCOM","n":"305-0","s":"70","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":8,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":15}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 1-223"],"d":"2023-08-20","e":"2023-11-30","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: NUQ: Students who have completed IMC330-0 or STRATCOM 303-0, sophomores and above","p":[["Overview of class","<p>This is an advanced, hands-on course designed to give students the skills to develop effective PR content and messages on behalf of brands, commercial or non-profit organizations.

They are usually concerned with rectifying an existing social \"wrong\"—something unjust, oppressive, discriminatory, or exclusionary—by directly mobilizing people through non-traditional political and judicial routes. In many cases, social movements involve \"demands\" that aim to capture public attention and pressure governmental action. This course will seek to further our understanding of social movements by posing and exploring a series of questions: Why do social movements occur, often in clusters, more frequently in some periods than in others? What are the main theories of social movements? How have social movements changed over time? How has our understanding of social movements changed over time? What are social movement organizations (SMOs) and how do they function? Why do some people, not others, become active participants in social movements? How has globalization affected social movements? How have new technologies of information and communications influenced the scope and function of social movements? What are the strategies and tactics, both discursive and non-discursive, that social movements deploy to publicize their goals and demands? Why do some social movements succeed while others fail?

The term \"public\" signifies relatively unrestricted communication across civil society regarding governance and other matters affecting the general welfare. Theoretical articulation of the \"public sphere\" has directed critical understanding of key institutions in modern societies, including the liberal-democratic state, capitalist social relations, the media and culture industries, and social movement protests. Similarly, another set of concepts such as audience, spectator and spectatorship, crowds, parades and marches, rallies, carnivals, fairs, and festivals, both calendric and contingent, have becomes equally indispensable for understanding the dynamics of the capitalist political economy which is dependent on ever escalating consumption cycles. This seminar will focus on the crossing of these two networks of concepts, one foregrounding the political subjectivity of the citizen and the other targeting the market subjectivity of the consumer, to identify and analyze a full range of deep problems afflicting the seemingly \"ungovernable\" liberal-capitalist democratic societies today. Readings include John Dewey, Walter Lippmann, Jürgen Habermas, Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Nestor Garca Canclini, Miriam Hansen, Michael Warner, Lauren Berlant, John Peters, and others."]]}]},{"i":"024727","c":"SPCH","t":"History of Media Technologies","u":"COMM_ST","n":"489-0","s":[{"i":"024727-1","r":[{"n":"James Joseph Hodge","p":"847 4915675","a":"University Hall Room 408"}],"t":"History of Media Technologies","u":"COMM_ST","n":"489-0","s":"1","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 3622"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":12,"p":[["Overview of class","This seminar examines the late twentieth- and twenty-first century emergence and saturation of contemporary culture by personalized electronic and computational technologies, primarily in the Anglophone West. The increasing cultural prominence of portable devices such as the Sony Walkman and the newly domestic character of \"personal\" computing -- from the Apple Macintosh to laptops to smartphones and networked applications -- through Michel Foucault's late career idea of \"techniques of the self.\" For Foucault, such practices \"permit individuals to effect by their own means, or with the help of others, a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality.\" While Foucault had a much longer historical perspective in mind, we will consider the novel prominence of technologies of the self and selfhood within the context of neoliberalism where the task of entrepreneurial self-management comes to define the ideology of personhood. Central to our inquiry, then, will be not only the literal technologies of the historical present but also the ways in which media technologies as well as aesthetics newly conjugate subject and environment in terms of a felt pressure to manage that relation. Notions of ambience and the ambient will be central to our investigations as well as the role of technological aesthetics in providing not only beauty or entertainment but rather moment-to-moment tactics of mood management. Topics may include ambient music, ASMR, self-care, and habit. Aesthetic texts may include works by Brian Eno, Tan Lin, Claudia Rankine, and Tsai Ming-Ling.

Slowing them down so that we can teach the bones of our body not to lift and hypertense - which, for instance, standing up straight and core strength promote - but rather to \"sit\" and \"hang\" in response to gravity's downward pull.

We practice this apparently paradoxical approach to moving and vocalizing in all of our exercises beginning with the one called Constructive Rest. In it, we use visualizations to help the body's bones go where the pull of gravity is directing them to go"],["Registration Requirements","Sophomore, Juniors, and Senior Theatre majors who have taken Dance 161 JRJ I"]]}]},{"i":"004728","c":"SPCH","t":"Classical Dance II","u":"DANCE","n":"270-0","s":[{"i":"004728-20","r":[{"n":"Vanessa Valecillos","o":"11 am to 12:30pm Monday and Wednesday by appointment only"}],"t":"Classical Dance II","u":"DANCE","n":"270-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":20}],"l":["Wirtz Center Ballroom"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":18,"p":[["Overview of class","This course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to continue more advanced classical ballet with an emphasis on technical development.

The course offers us the urgent opportunity to explore the aesthetic foundations of contemporary dance as they have been created and framed by African American aesthetic structures and practices. As with American music, which has been largely influenced by the articulation of jazz, contemporary dance performance has been enabled by participation in structures of Black Dance. The course includes historical overview of key figures, performance venues, and events that have defined the form, as well as important works of art created in this mode. To take on the question of how Black Dance exists, we will attempt to articulate structures of composition and performance that are commonly described as Black. Working with cultural criticism contemporary with emergent modes of Black Dance, we will assess the political motivations and aesthetic strategies of artists and writers working explicitly in this idiom. We will also look closely at current Africanist scholarship that assumes the possibility of Black dance performed by people of First World, European, Latinx, and Asian descent. While this is not a course of dancing, we will dance together at times in the semester. Hopefully, by the end of the semester, we will come to understand aesthetic structures of Black performance; genealogies of modes of Black dance; and particular histories of several artists and dancers that every educated person might encounter."],["Evaluation Method","The course requirements include five aspects: participation, leading question essays, midterm examination, and final paper. 1. PARTICIPATION: Attendance is mandatory, unless previously excused. Each student will be expected to keep pace with the required reading assignments and to partake rigorously in classroom discussion. Reading assignments should be completed and students prepared for classroom discussion on the day that reading assignments are due. In addition, working in pairs, each student will participate in the rudimentary demonstration of aspects of Black Dance in our shared practice sessions. The modes of dance address are as follows: Stepping Tap Dance and Jazz B-girl and B-Boy Vogue and J-Setting Participation is worth 20% of the final grade (20 points). 2. LEADING QUESTION ESSAYS (LQEs): Each student will be required to submit one (1) leading-question essay regarding the assigned readings, viewings, guest artists, or performance events to the instructor by 12 noon before the class session. These questions will serve as the basis for discussion of assigned readings and related course events. Each \"essay\" should begin with an actual question, followed by no more than two double-spaced pages that provide context for the implications and sources of that question. Each of these essays will be no longer than two pages, double-spaced. The seven LQEs are due xxxxxx 5 points each; 35 points total. 3. MID-TERM EXAMINATION: A mid-term examination will be offered in class on xxxxx. The exam will include multiple question, short answer, and a longer interpretive essay. The exam will allow you to demonstrate your accumulation of sophistication in thinking through attributes of Black Dance practices. The mid-term examination is worth 15 points total. 4. FINAL PAPER: Each class member will write a term research paper of 7-9 pages length, on a subject to be determined in consultation with the instructor. Paper proposals are due xxxxx; a paper draft is due xxxxx; and the final paper is due by 5pm xxxxx. The final paper shall be worth 30 points total.

In communication and the organizational sciences, extraordinary developments in computing and telecommunications have engendered new organizational forms based on fluid, dynamic networks. These new network forms of self-organization are constantly evolving in dynamic communities as new network links are created and dysfunctional ones dissolved. While many writers assert that the capability to nurture networks will differentiate dominant 21st century organizations, little is known about how this important organizational form emerges and evolves. This seminar is intended to review theoretical, conceptual, and analytic issues associated with network perspectives on communicating and organizing. The course will review scholarship on the science of networks in communication, computer science, economics, engineering, organizational science, life sciences, physical sciences, political science, psychology, and sociology in order to take an in-depth look at theories, methods, and tools to examine the structure and dynamics of networks. Most class time will be spent discussing the assigned readings. Laboratory exercises will provide experience with network analysis, modeling and visualization tools. A term paper is expected advancing some theoretical, methodological, or computational aspect of network science. Prerequisites\nThe course has no formal pre-requisites but will be most beneficial to students who have had an introductory statistics course covering descriptive statistics for central tendencies and dispersion, correlation, sampling, and significance testing.

This course looks at ethnographies of artistic practice to better understand how culture is made, circulated, and received in social life. Aiming to go beyond the personal idiosyncrasies of individual artists and media players, it shows through a myriad of studies in cultural production, what are the factors that play the greatest role in shaping contemporary cultural production: is it about professional traditions, forms of ownership and funding, government regulations, organizational factors or the social dynamics in the interplay between owners, workers, and audiences? Sorting out the factors that shape cultural production can best be accomplished via comparative research - across geographical regions, and institutional fields. This course offers a theoretical and methodological roadmap to such a project, helping students navigate through the landscape of how contemporary culture is produced.

Through experiences, how do the media industries exert control over their narrative/production worlds and even authorize how one should experience media? What sort of access do experiences provide to audiences/fans and how do audiences/fans challenge, comply, or collaborate within these boundaries?

However, the films, television shows, videogames, and popular recordings that we enjoy are produced, distributed, and marketed using the techniques and strategies of modern industry: that is, show business is just as much about the business as it is the show. This combination of art and industry has long sparked debate about the status of the cultural or creative industries, and the ways in which they intermingle art and commerce. What is distinctive about the creative industries as industries? What makes an \"authentic\" expression within this context? Where does the creativity lie in the complex and collaborative productions of the creative industries? What role do advertising and market research play in shaping creative products? To what degree can audiences take an active role in their experience of creative works? How have technological or regulatory developments influenced the way in which creative products are produced, distributed and consumed? What is the culture of work in the creative industries, and how can it be made to be more diverse and inclusive? How can media texts be made so that they cross cultural or national boundaries? This course will address these and other questions through an engagement with scholarship on a range of media industries including film, radio, television, popular music, advertising, animation, and digital gaming. The course is designed to provide a historical and theoretical introduction to media industries and to allow students to apply that knowledge to a range of industrial contexts.

This course aims to give sound professionals a grounding in that conversation by immersing them in Sound Studies, a new and inspiring field that occupies an intersection between the arts, social sciences and humanities.</p> <p>Sound Studies helps us to understand how music works through the popular media, interprets and unpacks great soundtracks and albums, uncovers the history of the sound technologies that we use, asks how hearing changes over time and across cultures, looks at the politics behind forms of vocal expression and mixing particularly around issues of race, gender and identity, and calls attention to sonic dimensions of environments. In recent years, Sound Studies has also been taking the form of sound and provides raw ideas for podcasts, films and other sound works. Indeed, it was scholar Murray Schafer who coined the term \"soundscape,\" a concept that is now not only used by a whole field of artists, but also by acousticians, game developers and urban planners.</p> <p>Each week we begin by considering significant works of sonic expression, using them as a framework to understand key questions in Sound Studies today. Though much of our emphasis will be on sound in popular forms of media, we will also consider various forms of sound technology, sound art, and sound performance. Students will be introduced to a range of sound-based industries and learn how they work together. Key works of sound art and design will demonstrate the aesthetics of sound, for example: the expressive ways in which sounds are combined with images in media culture; and how mediated sounds facilitate new encounters with the lived environment. Students will gain an understanding of how sound mediates identity and provides a medium for cultural expression.</p>"],["Learning Objectives","<ul>\n<li>To give sound producers a sense of the guiding questions, problems and projects in sound studies today.</li> <li>To acquaint students with the histories of the devices, techniques and industries shaping sound production across cultures, and particularly with how politics and social difference shape sound creation and reception. </li> <li>To break down the walls between sound theory and sound practice by focusing on how key innovations have inspired both.</li> <li>To inspire original thinking about sound that is rooted in its multi-model past and future.</li>\n</ul>"],["Evaluation Method","<p>Assessment breakdown: </p> <p>Participation 20%<br/>\nGroup Presentation 10%<br/> Short Essay 30%<br/> Theory to Practice Project 40%</p> <p>Regular attendance and active participation are expected.

You might use the Hilmes reading as an example for what a \"review essay\" looks like, structurally. The more specific your subfield, the better. For example, students interested in film might look at the most recent scholarship on how music and effects work in digital cinema, while those interested in gaming might consider recent sound studies texts exploring key figures in that field. Students must have a tentative bibliography of three or four possible books by Week 4. The project is due Week 6.</p> <p>This is a survey course that necessarily skims a very broad set of materials. The review essay assignment is designed to give you the opportunity to dig deeper in a subject area that's important to you personally, something you want to achieve greater depth in.</p> <p><strong>Group Presentation.</strong> In Week One I will put you in groups. Each group is responsible for coming to class with one audio track of some kind - a song, a field recording, a bit of their own tape, a youtube video - that responds to a reading from the week. Students will play and explain their choice.</p> <p><strong>Theory to Practice Project.</strong> Students will be required to produce a final project that uses sound practice to solve, complicate, or reimagine a question we have discussed in the course of our readings. The main criterion is that the project must use sound to answer a research question that can't be answered without it. Students are encouraged to use this project as a prototype for their eventual final capstone study in sound at the end of the MA sequence in Spring. Students must meet one-on-one with faculty by the end of Week 7 to approve a plan.

It will provide students with significant tools of play analysis while also foregrounding what can be learned through the rehearsal and performance of theatrical texts. We will (in general) cover a new play every two weeks: the first week will focus on understanding the text and raising additional analytical issues around the play or Shakespeare's life and times; the second week will pick up where we left off, but it will also include scene work performed by the class.

We'll question which historical narratives are being told and which are being ignored, and we'll ask why and how genres like fantasy, sci-fi, fairy tales, and time travel are commonly used to bring stories of mass-violence to the public. (3) HOLOCAUST MEMORY, MEMORIALS & MUSEUMS - Spring Quarter (LS 323) Previously Trauma and Atrocity: Holocaust Memory, Memorial and Museums (SESP 323) In this course, we'll draw connections between individual trauma, intergenerational memory, and the politics of collective memory and collective forgetting.

In our view, action research is not distinct from the work of teaching and educating, rather when done well it drives the work of teaching and learning. Data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings on a daily basis—we are responsible for mining and learning from them. As a result of these courses you will not only have designed and conducted action research— your Master's Project —but more importantly, you will have a set of stances and tools to embark on a career as an educator scholar who continues to notice various aspects of teaching and learning, ask important questions, and engage in meaningful, guided examinations of practice to evolve learning. The goal of MSED 407-1 and 407-2 is to help you become informed educators who are able to turn curiosities and challenges from your settings into potential areas of structured reflection and research. The basis of the course is the model of action research — of studying our own settings around questions we are passionate about, for the purpose of improving our students and colleagues learning as well as our own practice. Action research is not distinct from the work of teaching, rather the data we use in action research is precisely that which we encounter in our educational settings daily.

class","Social policy is integral to the fabric of society. It helps to determine who has access to resources and services, regulates how those are obtained, and is constantly negotiated by changing ideas about public need and the common good. A primary goal of this course is to explore social policy in the United States as a political, economic, and ideological process that is embedded in the racialized, classed, and gendered context of American society. In this class, we will learn about factors that shape policymaking, examine ways that policy impacts society through institutional and interpersonal pathways, and practice skills to analyze policy from development to implementation. The first part of the course will focus on policy framing and development as key elements of policymaking. We will examine how social issues become policy problems, how and why policy agendas are set, whose voice is represented, and how research is engaged in the policymaking process. We will form policy workgroups to examine specific policy problems and learn about the ways that policy seeks to address social issues like poverty, educational access, and violence. Individually, students will have the opportunity to focus in on a specific social issue that is meaningful to them and explore how policy is used to address it. The second part of the course will focus on policy implementation, with an emphasis on the ways that policy impacts people differently depending on their identity, social status, and positionality in society. We will develop policy analysis skills, use analytical tools to examine impact, and learn how to read, write, and interrogate policy briefs as public-facing documents."]]}]},{"i":"015787","c":"SESP","t":"Special Topics in Social Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"351-0","s":[{"i":"015787-20","r":[{"n":"Tabitha Bonilla"}],"t":"Special Topics in Social Policy","k":"Intersectionality, Measurement and Public Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"351-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G02"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":35,"p":[["Overview of class","As understanding of identity and bias increased, activists and scholars developed the theory of intersectionality which challenges us to consider various components of identities as having the potential to create overlapping and intersecting experiences. When an individual holds multiple identities that have traditionally been marginalized, any discrimination experienced will be different than someone without that unique blend of identities. To use Crenshaw's initial example in 1989, Black women experience a different type of racism than Black men, and a different form of sexism than White women. Thirty years later, researchers still are coming to terms with what this means in the public sphere, but also in research which underlines the importance of thinking about identity more comprehensively and completely. In this class, we will begin by addressing the question of what intersectionality is. We will also consider how considering identity as intersectional alters our understanding of policy, and what policy should address. Importantly, we will consider how to incorporate intersectionality into a basic framework of research and analysis through a term-long project."],["Registration Requirements","No First-Years\nMethodology Class Preferred"]]}]},{"i":"000852","c":"SESP","t":"Schooling in America","u":"TEACH_ED","n":"301-0","s":[{"i":"000852-20","r":[{"n":"Corrie L Cockrell"}],"t":"Schooling in America","u":"TEACH_ED","n":"301-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: AntiReq: Students must not have already completed TEACH_ED 351 topic Schooling in America to enroll."}]},{"i":"017367","c":"SESP","t":"Social, Cultural, and Linguistic Contexts of Education","u":"TEACH_ED","n":"302-0","s":[{"i":"017367-20","r":[{"n":"Elizabeth Rose Shulman"},{"n":"Marcus Arthur Campbell"}],"t":"Social, Cultural, and Linguistic Contexts of Education","u":"TEACH_ED","n":"302-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 303"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":9,"p":[["Overview of class","This course is designed to explore how the ways that we live culturally provide strengths for teaching, learning and design.

The primary goal of this course is to strengthen oral and written communication and comprehension skills as well as cross-cultural competence by immersing students in authentic cultural contexts, materials, and language and by engaging in a variety of communicative activities. A review and deepening of essential grammar will reinforce linguistic foundations. The teaching methodology for this course uses the flipped model: students learn grammar and vocabulary at home with Flipped French, a pioneering courseware developed by faculty in the French Department at Northwestern. Class activities are devoted to conversation and other communicative activities that allow students to practice what they learned while exploring contemporary French and Francophone cultures. This course enables students to actively participate in a French-speaking environment, prepare for further studies in French, and provide a path to proficiency. This hybrid course meets on campus/in person once weekly with online activities during the week. Students are expected to attend the weekly in-person class and actively participate, to complete the online activities during the week, and to spend at least two hours of work outside of class for each hour of class.

We will explore transformations such as the rise of European naval power and of proto-capitalism, while also examining important developments in Asia, Africa, and the Americas before and during the rise of European imperialism. We will closely examine the consequences of increasing interconnectedness, seeing how the exchange of goods, ideas, microbes, and technology impacted people and landscapes around the world. Through these inquiries we will develop a rich understanding of the contingency of global history, acquire new perspective on familiar events by examining them through a global lens, and challenge simplified narratives that postulate the inevitability of Western ascendency in the 19th century."]]}]},{"i":"017664","c":"UC","t":"Leading, Acting, and Thinking Strategically","u":"LEAD_ART","n":"200-0","s":[{"i":"017664-42","r":[{"n":"John A Cooper"}],"t":"Leading, Acting, and Thinking Strategically","u":"LEAD_ART","n":"200-0","s":"42","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":30}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2023-10-30","e":"2023-11-20","c":"LEC","a":18}]},{"i":"017666","c":"UC","t":"Leaders as Change Agents","u":"LEAD_ART","n":"202-0","s":[{"i":"017666-42","r":[{"n":"Kelly Lynn Ross"}],"t":"Leaders as Change Agents","u":"LEAD_ART","n":"202-0","s":"42","m":["03"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":0}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2023-11-27","e":"2023-12-14","c":"LEC","a":25}]},{"i":"020333","c":"UC","t":"Developing People and Teams","u":"LEAD_ART","n":"204-0","s":[{"i":"020333-42","r":[{"n":"E Bliss Hansen"}],"t":"Developing People and Teams","u":"LEAD_ART","n":"204-0","s":"42","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":19,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":30}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2023-10-02","e":"2023-10-25","c":"LEC","a":12}]},{"i":"018304","c":"UC","t":"Topics in Comparative Literature","u":"LIT","n":"480-0","s":[{"i":"018304-50","r":[{"n":"Elzbieta Maria Foeller-Pituch"}],"t":"Topics in Comparative Literature","u":"LIT","n":"480-0","s":"50","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":19,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":21,"m":30}],"l":["University Hall 118"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-09","c":"LEC","a":20,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Program Pre-req"}]},{"i":"018306","c":"UC","t":"Special Topics","u":"LIT","n":"492-0","s":[{"i":"018306-50","r":[{"n":"Angelo Restivo"}],"t":"Special Topics","k":"Films about Filmmaking","u":"LIT","n":"492-0","s":"50","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":19,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":21,"m":30}],"l":["Wieboldt Hall 516"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-09","c":"LEC","a":20,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Program Prereq"}]},{"i":"023485","c":"UC","t":"Single-Variable Differential Calculus","u":"MATH","n":"220-A","s":[{"i":"023485-64","r":[{"n":"Amy Beth Alznauer","b":"Amy Alznauer has a M.S. in mathematics from the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana and an M.F.A. in writing from the University of Pittsburgh.

We'll then discuss how to think like a social scientist, with an attitude of open mindedness and skepticism, as we observe people in different social settings. Discussion will include the tools and methods that are used by social scientists to formulate their questions and propose answers. With the tools of neuroscience we will explore the biological underpinnings of mind and emotions and how they influence behavior. We will seek to understand and have empathy with individuals suffering from psychological disorders ranging from mild depression to severe psychosis. Discussion will cover ways to diagnose psychopathology and therapies that have been proposed to heal such internal suffering. Practical skills for coping with stress and emotions will also be explored.

They promise spatial and social connectivity, environmental control, technological modernization, and development in the age of Anthropocene defined as the era in which human activities play a dominant role in environmental changes. However, they also lead to uneven access to resources, prevent mobility, and produce injustices and socio-political conflicts. This course will scrutinize infrastructures to discuss their social, political, and environmental lives. We will read and discuss anthropological studies that examine how infrastructures are constructed, used, maintained, and repaired in everyday life. In this exploration, we will pay specific attention to power relations, social meanings, and environmental transformations that shape and are shaped by infrastructures. Conceptual themes include, among others, urban citizenship, state power, social conflicts, securitization, violence, community building, and ecology. These themes will be explored through the focus on water systems, renewable energy, road projects, waste facilities, oil extraction, housing, and other infrastructures. We will pay specific attention to infrastructure and its politics in the Global South, through readings and other course materials on regions such as the Middle East and North Africa, South East Asia, Africa, and South America.

The first is that many modern ailments may be viewed as an imbalance between modern life ways and those which shaped our biology during much of human evolution. The second is that differences in factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical factors, help explain why some groups tend to be more affected by these conditions than others. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive and sensitive to the environments that we inhabit.

On an empirical level this may be because archaeological remains of houses are ubiquitous in the archaeological record. On a theoretical level this may be because studies of households lead us to focus on peopled pasts. Thus despite its short history, household archaeology has taken a leading role in epistemological shifts which place people and their practices and differences at the center of archaeological interpretations of the past, rather than subsuming these into the \"noise\" of passive and depersonalized depictions of social systems. Our studies of household archaeology across this course will lead us to consider the importance of studying everyday life in the past. A study of everyday life in the past can lead to a more democratic understanding of societies inclusive of the full range of people that inhabited past societies. Studies of households and everyday life are not without their detractors and these detractors are often quite hostile. Because households and daily life are often considered \"micro\" domains were people interact with one another, they are not considered suitable areas of studies to answer \"macro\" questions of politics and society. In this class we will explore how \"micro\" and \"macro\" intersect in the analysis households and daily life making these vibrant domains to understand how micro (self, interaction, experience) and macro (institutions, power relations, society) merge as they shape and are shaped by people and societies.

The urgency of redressing art history's lingering complicities with white supremacy, coloniality, and the profit motive propels us to reconsider foundational questions: What is art? What is history? What is an object? What is scholarship? What is a method? What is an archive? This seminar addresses these and other questions from perspectives both within and beyond art history, including Black Studies, Indigenous Studies, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial theory, new materialisms, among others. Rather than assimilating subaltern voices into a hegemonic \"global art history,\" the seminar begins with the premise that art history needs rebuilding from the ground up. The goal is to work proactively and collectively towards new horizons of art historical scholarship by attending to a diverse body of methodologies that offer dynamic ways of reconceptualizing art historical narration, (inter)disciplinarity, canonization, and research. While theory and historiography will be the abiding focus of the course, students will also be asked to bring in specific examples of art, architecture, and visual and material culture to ground our discussions in practices of object analysis."],["Class Materials (Required)","N/A"],["Class Notes","Please use the following link for Art History Waitlist information: https://arthistory.northwestern.edu/courses/2023-2024/waitlist.html"]]}]},{"i":"001288","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in 17th & 18th Century Art","u":"ART_HIST","n":"440-0","s":[{"i":"001288-1","r":[{"n":"Alicia Caticha"}],"t":"Studies in 17th & 18th Century Art","k":"Marble","u":"ART_HIST","n":"440-0","s":"1","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge 4354 Art Hist.

How do we decolonize epistemologies about Asia in our research and pedagogies? We will engage these questions by first of all understanding the genealogies and the definitions and research practices in the field of Asian studies, our own as well as others'. We will then move on to discuss together how to describe research topics, articulate research questions, and identify primary materials through which to explore them; how to find, read, evaluate, and make original use of existing scholarship; how to use library research to frame and inform the analysis of primary cultural materials; and how to communicate the aims and results of research to a community of peers. Regardless of whether our respective area/s of interest lies in the early modern, modern, and contemporary periods and in the local, national, regional contexts of Asia, the goal of our time together will be to imagine and map ways in which we can carry out and write meaningful research.

The realm of the invisible includes the components of the fascinating history of radio astronomy, and numerous discoveries over the last 90 years (e.g., pulsars, quasars, the Big Bang background radiation, organic molecules) and fundamental differences between radio and optical telescopes. Before 1931, the study of the universe was limited to optical observations of the night sky. Karl Jansky changed everything by building a radio telescope that could observe the sky day or night. We are all familiar with radio frequencies by listening to FM radio stations and using GPS satellites for navigation. Radio astronomy is the study of natural radio emission from celestial objects at frequencies outside FM and GPS frequencies. The human eye can see optical light but is blind to radio signals, including those that provide important clues about the history of our universe. The radio band is very broad, spanning 100,000 Hz between 10^7 to 10^12 Hz, whereas our eyes are only sensitive between red and blue, a factor of two.

And biological phenomena, such as infection and disease, interact with non-biological elements of human society.

An overwhelming majority of people agree that we should work to save biodiversity, but their views are largely based on vague, positive feelings about nature rather than concrete justifications. This course investigates those concrete justifications. The first half of the course sketches out the argument for preserving biodiversity (i.e., \"thinking globally\"). The second half of the course focuses on the practice of ecological restoration in forest preserves a few miles from campus (i.e., \"acting locally\") not merely as a way to preserve biodiversity, but as a path to redefining a sustainable relationship between nature and culture. The readings for the course range from classics of environmental writing to recent research papers in the primary scientific literature. Biodiversity also needs to be experienced directly, so we will take a field trip to a local forest preserve where we will roll up our sleeves and help restore a native habitat and see how much biodiversity means to the people with whom we live and work."],["Teaching Method","In class discussion"],["Evaluation Method","Participation in and leadership of group discussions accounts is 30% of the grade.

class","Skilled writers paint vivid images with their words, as do compelling thinkers. Description is a practice of carefully evoking the observable properties of a thing, event, text, or cultural phenomena for a reader that may not share said experience. This course introduces students to the craft of thick description of cultural artefacts and happenings that would serve them in a plethora of academic and creative pursuits at and beyond the university. Students will also learn to mobilize description as evidence in academic writing and as a means for forging persuasive arguments. Course exercises will include in a combination of ethnography assignments; close reading of objects, events and ephemera, classroom readings; peer feedback; and, crucially, the patient art of revising one's writing. The craft of description should prepare students for work in a multitude of disciplines and intellectual curiosities."]]},{"i":"024777-21","r":[{"n":"Mary E Pattillo","p":"847/491-3409","a":"1860 Campus Dr. Crowe 5-111","o":"TBA"}],"t":"College Seminar","k":"'A Dark Rock Surged Upon': Navigating Race, Class,","u":"BLK_ST","n":"101-7","s":"21","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-329"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15}]},{"i":"001195","c":"WCAS","t":"Introduction to African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"236-0","s":[{"i":"001195-20","r":[{"n":"Kihana Miraya Ross"}],"t":"Introduction to African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"236-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":30,"o":"63","f":"63"}]},{"i":"020626","c":"WCAS","t":"Religion in the Black Atlantic","u":"BLK_ST","n":"315-0","s":[{"i":"020626-20","r":[{"n":"Kijan A Bloomfield"}],"t":"Religion in the Black Atlantic","u":"BLK_ST","n":"315-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":30,"o":"4765","f":"46"}]},{"i":"001218","c":"WCAS","t":"Topics in African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":[{"i":"001218-20","r":[{"n":"Herman Barnor Hesse","p":"8474913775","a":"1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-131"}],"t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Black Political Thought","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Parkes Hall 215"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":30},{"i":"001218-22","r":[{"n":"Justin L Mann"}],"t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Black Feminist World-Making","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"22","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 214"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":5,"f":"6"},{"i":"001218-23","r":[{"n":"Thomas Faburn DeFrantz"}],"t":"Topics in African-American Studies","k":"Black Dance","u":"BLK_ST","n":"380-0","s":"23","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["Louis Hall 226"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":5}]},{"i":"001221","c":"WCAS","t":"Internship in African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"396-0","s":[{"i":"001221-20","t":"Internship in African-American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"396-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15}]},{"i":"018093","c":"WCAS","t":"Research Seminar in Black Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"401-0","s":[{"i":"018093-1","r":[{"n":"Kihana Miraya Ross"}],"t":"Research Seminar in Black Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"401-0","s":"1","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":40}],"l":["Crowe 5-138 Af Am Studies Sem"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15}]},{"i":"019283","c":"WCAS","t":"Graduate Topics in African American Studies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"480-0","s":[{"i":"019283-20","r":[{"n":"Herman Barnor Hesse","p":"8474913775","a":"1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-131"}],"t":"Graduate Topics in African American Studies","k":"Black Conceptual Methodologies","u":"BLK_ST","n":"480-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":20}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-435"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15},{"i":"019283-21","r":[{"n":"Leslie Maria Harris","p":"847/491-3153","a":"Harris Hall -

A related topic of my focus is how the currencies and safe assets are intermediated in the international monetary system, how they generate a liquidity premium in this intermediation process, and how this process is affected by the monetary policy.

The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements. Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector. To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management. Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends. The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.

In this seminar, we will discuss what is so special about the size range of 1-100 nm (the nanoscale) and why particles of this size have a such a unique niche in nature and technology. We will explore the properties of these materials and why quantum mechanical effects allow for this scale to be so important. Discussions of medicines, electronics, catalysts, additives, and imaging agents that include nanoparticles will allow us to explore the wide range of current directions of nanotechnology. As we look to future applications, we will debate the implications of these materials on the environment, human health, and safety. Regulatory bodies in the United States and around the globe have discussed the ethical and social impact of nanomaterials, and we will investigate their role is assuring the nanomaterials we use leave a positive impact on the world."],["Class Materials (Required)","Title: Prey\nAuthor: Michael Crichton\nPublisher: Harper Collins\nISBN: 9780066214122\nApprox. price: $27\nThe digital copy is fine too."]]}]},{"i":"022460","c":"WCAS","t":"Quantitative Problem Solving in Chemistry","u":"CHEM","n":"110-0","s":[{"i":"022460-01","r":[{"n":"Carine Rita Nemr"}],"t":"Quantitative Problem Solving in Chemistry","u":"CHEM","n":"110-0","s":"01","m":["01234","3","3"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0},{"h":19,"m":0},{"h":19,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":50},{"h":21,"m":0},{"h":21,"m":0}],"l":["Technological Institute M345","Location of Midterm TBD","Location of Midterm TBD"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":75,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Eligibility is determined by Chemistry’s Initial Assessment (IA); except that students who took AP chemistry are ineligible for CHEM 110.

As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors. The full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of: instrumental analysis\nsynthesis of inorganic compounds\nsynthesis of organic compounds\nspectroscopy The course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example: - A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure. Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made. - A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest. In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses. Chemistry 350-1: Roughly half of this course deals with the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

What is certain, however, is that, one way or another, Freud's theories and ideas have marked the world for all time.

Students will also engage critically with the many challenges to, as well as the reinterpretations and reappropriations of, Freud's theories over the past century and a quarter, weighing the respective arguments and analyzing their implications for our understandings of self and society as well as for the actions that result from these understandings.\n Students will be able to evaluate their own assumptions in regard to the above-listed topics and potentially reevaluate their beliefs in light of both Freud's theories and the subsequent challenges to them.

The course approaches this question by considering several key trends in Latin American literature in the second half of the twentieth century. Focusing on novels, short fiction, and testimonial writing & film, we will study representative works from the so-called pre-Boom, Boom, and post-Boom decades (1940s-50s, 1960s-70s, 1980s). Although the new narrative is often identified with Boom novels (such as One Hundred Years of Solitude) and with the Boom era overall—when Latin American literature \"exploded\" onto the world stage--we will take a broader view to consider the diverse types of narrative representing \"new\" currents in the region. Reading and discussion will focus on formal aspects of narrative and on cultural and historical contexts that shaped the production and reception of new narrative works by well-known figures. Primary texts: Borges's and Cortázar's \"fantastic\" fictions and essays on narrative poetics; Fuentes's revolutionary Boom novel about 20th-century Mexico (The Death of Artemio Cruz); Ferré's irreverent feminist stories about Puerto Rican society and culture; Valenzuela's ironic dramatic fictions about political repression in Argentina; García Márquez's documentary-testimonial tale about an exiled filmmaker's covert return home during the Pinochet era (Clandestine in Chile: The Adventures of Miguel Littin).

After examining related examples of comparative and interdisciplinary scholarship in a worldly mode (by Glissant, Lowe, Chow, Buck-Morss, and others), the final part of the course reconsiders the planetary concerns of EH (in the work of Heise, Chakrabarty, Pratt, and others) in light of CLS's commitment to thinking literature and other creative forms in situated and relational terms."]]}]},{"i":"001636","c":"WCAS","t":"Comparative Studies in Theme","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"413-0","s":[{"i":"001636-20","r":[{"n":"Tristram Nash Wolff"}],"t":"Comparative Studies in Theme","k":"Lyric Environments","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"413-0","s":"20","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":12,"p":[["Overview of class","Lyric Environments.

For the first three weeks of the class, we will read the three sections of the Origins along with a selection of Arendt's contemporaneous writings on issues at the heart of her study: wide-scale statelessness and forced migration; racism and imperial expansion; totalitarian propaganda and the \"holes of oblivion.\" Arendt recognized that the Origins posed a question that remained unanswered in that work: faced with the manufacture of living corpses, what preserves our humanity and redeems our actions? Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity: from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action. As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity—namely, the dimensions of the \"active life\"—we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a \"contemplative life\" concretized. This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where Arendt re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness. As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human \"conditionality,\" and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics."],["Class Materials (Required)","Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (any edition)\nArendt, The Human Condition (any edition)\nArendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem (any edition)\nAdditional texts available on Canvas"]]}]},{"i":"001638","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in Literature and the Arts","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"487-0","s":[{"i":"001638-1","r":[{"n":"Maria Alejandra Uslenghi","p":"847/467-1713","a":"3-113 Crowe"}],"t":"Studies in Literature and the Arts","k":"Archive Poetics: Subaltern Knowledges & Irreverent","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"487-0","s":"1","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 214"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","Archive Poetics: Subaltern Knowledges and Irreverent Uses This seminar studies the contemporary appropriation, uses and reactivations of cultural archives in modern and contemporary Argentine literature and culture.

At the same time, however, \"freedom\" is a thoroughly ambiguous and dubious word that, from the beginning of its function as a basic concept, contained implicit and explicit programs for new forms of domination, including domination in the relation of the self to itself, to the world, and to others. For this reason, a critique of freedom is necessary.\nThe seminar will focus on the idea that freedom exists only in becoming, that is, as \"liberation.\" For it is precisely this idea of liberation that underlies the dominant narratives of post-classical Western culture (and modernity in particular): liberation defines its notions of history, subjectivity, education, politics, the arts, etc. And it is therefore also the thought and process of liberation that most clearly exhibits the dialectical knot that links freedom and domination in their contradiction. From this perspective, processes of liberation will be examined in the seminar. We will ask, for example: what drives those processes? How do they proceed? How do they fail and/or how do they establish new orders of domination?\nThe seminar will pursue these questions by examining a variety of methodological approaches. These include the following: the exploration of the putative Greek origin of Western freedom in the history of ideas (Meier, Patterson, Raaflaub); the systematic conceptualization of the relations between freedom, capacity, and habit (Arendt, Hegel); the psycho-social analysis of the entanglement between emancipation and domination (Fanon, Hartman); the relation between experience and liberation in aesthetic theories of freedom (Adorno, Blanchot, Heidegger, Nancy); and the question of the relation between religion and freedom (Lévinas, Santner)."],["Registration Requirements","Reserved for Graduate Students."]]}]},{"i":"001640","c":"WCAS","t":"Independent Reading","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"490-0","s":[{"i":"001640-20","t":"Independent Reading","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"490-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":15}]},{"i":"001905","c":"WCAS","t":"The Ocean, the Atmosphere & Our Climate","u":"EARTH","n":"106-0","s":[{"i":"001905-01","r":[{"n":"Neal E Blair","p":"847/491-8790","a":"TECH A228","o":"As arranged (n-blair@northwestern.edu)"}],"t":"The Ocean, the Atmosphere & Our Climate","u":"EARTH","n":"106-0","s":"01","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute F285"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":40,"p":[["Overview of class","Most of our planet's surface is blanketed by ocean.

An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes). You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?, (ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services?

Utilize supply and demand curves to analyze equilibrium, the efficient allocation of resources, and the effects of various forms of government intervention in inherently competitive markets.\n2. Characterize a consumer's satisfaction-maximizing choices for goods given a limited budget, derive a consumer's demand curve for a product, and determine how a change in the price of a good affects a consumer's welfare. 3. Characterize the technology available to a firm, using production functions, cost curves, and supply curves.\n4.

We will also ponder the proper role of government in today's digital economy, which features a number of platforms featuring network effects that result in a small number of operating systems, streaming services or social networks. Finally, society might be willing to trade short-term welfare loss for long-term gains by granting temporary monopolies (e.g., patents or copyrights) to provide an incentive to innovate.

The importance of location in everyday choices is readily seen in your decision to live on or off campus (or in a new professor's decision to live in Evanston or downtown Chicago). Yet, traditional economic models do not account for spatial factors. As urban economists, we will use the tools of economic theory and empirical data to explore several interesting questions along the dimensions of why we live in cities and how do regions develop. These questions include, but are not limited to: Why do cities and regions exist? How do firms decide where to locate? Why do people live in cities? What determines the growth and size of a city and region? What is the role of cities in regional development? We will then analyze the economic problems that arise because we live in urban areas. We will focus on specific urban issues such as firm location, housing, education, transportation costs, immigration, and local government policies. Time permitting, we will briefly explore issues related to crime, poverty, and housing bubbles. We will cover a few empirical papers in class that you are expected to read in advance.

Working with medieval texts, such as the visions of mystic Margery Kempe, alongside modern medievalisms, like \"Game of Thrones\" and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, we will examine how writers and creators use language and rhetoric to create myths, communicate ideas, and structure arguments about a medieval past. Looking at modern cultural and political phenomena such as Harry Potter, D&D, and white supremacists' fantasies around medieval Europe, we will interrogate how powerful rhetoric, argumentation, and storytelling can have lasting and varied real-world implications. The primary objective of this course is to help you become a better writer, reader, and critical thinker. Through independent and in-class writing and discussion, we will practice communicating our own ideas clearly, engaging carefully with others' ideas, and structuring arguments using evidence. We will treat writing as a multi-step process that relies on an initial expression of ideas, and then careful revision and reworking of those ideas to build clarity, voice, style, and argumentative power."]]}]},{"i":"024816","c":"WCAS","t":"College Seminar","u":"ENGLISH","n":"105-7","s":[{"i":"024816-20","r":[{"n":"Meaghan Morrissa Fritz","p":"847/467-6162","a":"555 Clark St, #238"}],"t":"College Seminar","k":"I Guess This Is Growing Up: The Transition to Coll","u":"ENGLISH","n":"105-7","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 212"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","Welcome to Northwestern! Over the next ten weeks, first-year students all over campus will experience a flood of transitions as they adjust to college life. You'll experience exciting (and scary!) social transitions. Many of you might experience some degree of spatial transition, too, arriving to live on campus away, however far, from where you graduated high school. There are financial transitions, family transitions, and cultural transitions to contend with. In your courses this fall, many of you will experience academic transitions from high-school to college-level expectations of critical thinking, reading, and writing. As a student enrolled in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, you'll begin experiencing the interdisciplinarity of a liberal arts education right away, juggling multiple courses across varied disciplines starting in Week 1! This course aims to ease some of the transitions that you will experience at Northwestern as college students and as humans by defining, exploring, discussing, and reflecting on your own experiences, academic and otherwise, this quarter. To ground these conversations, we will spend the quarter reading and discussing Barbara Kingsolver's coming-of-age novel, Demon Copperhead, a work that embodies the exciting interdisciplinary overlaps of a liberal arts education. Through our exploration of Demon Copperhead, we will work together to cultivate productive study habits and to hone your critical thinking, reading, writing, and research skills for Northwestern classes. Our class will also serve as a social support system, as we work generously with one another through seminar discussion and a routine exchange of writing. Content Warning: Demon Copperhead is a beautiful coming-of-age novel told from the perspective of a narrator who is a survivor of nearly inconceivable loss. Although the story is oftentimes playful, funny, and romantic, it also touches on many sensitive and painful topics including: scenes of graphic drug use, addiction, and overdose; the U.S. foster care system; the opioid epidemic; homelessness; economic precarity; parental death; and grief."],["Class Materials (Required)","Barbara Kingsolver, Demon Copperhead.

In this course, we will focus on works of fiction and autobiography that pay special attention to the role that college plays in that journey.

In this course, students will examine the intersection of these two genres - that of traditional nature writing and environmental activist texts - with an eye to developing a portfolio of writing and communication work that showcases their unique voices, rhetorical strategies, and perspectives on this critically important topic. We will consider how people come to develop felt relationships to the natural world and what activist strategies seem to have the greatest potential to spark broad-based positive change. To that end, students will be asked to keep a journal of observation and reflections on the natural world as a foundation for later research and argumentative work. Some classes will be held outside at a range of campus (and possibly off-campus) locations, weather permitting, to allow for in-class observation and reflection workshops.

Indeed, in what ways are Western and East Asian literatures postcolonial?

Through a combination of reading about writing center pedagogies and practicing engaging with those methods in your work at the Writing Place, Practical Rhetoric seeks to prepare you to effectively coach writers at all stages of the writing process. In the spirit of the collaborative writing process that is at the heart of the Writing Place's mission, as writers this quarter, this course will ask you to regularly bring your own writing to class to workshop in a series of mock consultations and writing exercises with your classmates. You will reflect on your own positionality as a writer-- and consider what that positionality brings to your work at the Writing Place-- in a short writing assignment the first week of the quarter. You will continue to reflect on your learning in Practical Rhetoric and on your experiences working at the Writing Place in a series of weekly tutor journals. We will ask you to contribute to the work of writing center studies through your own research proposal, ideally on a topic or initiative that you can continue developing and perhaps even put into action in later quarters to improve and grow our services at the Writing Place.

This course explores the unique poetry of Blake alongside its experimental, politically committed, sometimes hallucinogenic afterlives. Blake — a deeply eccentric poet and engraver who was always an odd fit with his British Romantic contemporaries — might be seen as the prototype of the artistic genius outside their time: obscure while he lived, nearly two hundred years after his death he is ever more widely celebrated as a visionary iconoclast and outsider original. The course gives students a strong grounding in some of Blake's own most famous \"illuminated\" works, including Songs of Innocence and of Experience, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and America: A Prophecy, reading these alongside 20th & 21st-century works across and between genres. Emphasis will be placed on the poetic inventiveness of Blake's mixed-media forms, and his reinvention of the book, as we compare his illuminated poetry and innovative printing techniques with successors in poetry as well as across artistic media (including abstract expressionism, beat poetry, punk rock, and film media).

In 1891, four years before his trial for sodomy and indecency, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray shocked the Victorian public with its seductive exploration of queer sensuality, decadence, indulgence, and drug use.

We will explore key canonical works by authors including Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Henry James, and recover important aesthetic fantasies by lesser-known writers. Over the course of this class, students will build a foundational understanding of aesthetic theory and learn to interrogate texts through queer and postcolonial frameworks.

In the early nineteenth century, murder and other forms of gothic violence were often confined to remote castles or the wilds of the English moors. With the explosion of detective stories and crime fiction, however, these middle-class nightmares invaded both the supposedly blissful domestic scene and the modern city. Writers started to use murder as an occasion to pose radical questions about which deaths are considered \"grievable.\" Increasingly, authors depicted amateur detectives who were skeptical of the social and legal order they were reestablishing through their work. Beginning with founders of the genre Edgar Allen Poe and Pauline Hopkins (author of the first Black murder mystery), this course follows the transatlantic tradition forward through Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled tales, Agatha Christie's mysteries, mid-century psychological thrillers by Patricia Highsmith, and recent detective fiction by Walter Mosley. Paying particular attention to how gender and race shape the narration of these tales, we will conclude with a survey of twenty-first-century chart-toppers by Paula Hawkins and others.

This line would mark not only land and water but also racial and ethnic formations. Indigenous nations saw their territories split in half by a border that considered their homelands wilderness. Mexicans who found themselves north of the imagined line had to grapple with a new vocabulary to define themselves as they lost their lands to settlers. Those who ended up south of the border attempted to reconcile their recent independence from Spain with the loss of half of the country as they too tried to piece together a narrative for their new identity. This course will walk students through the text and maps of the 1848 treaty and the literary works that continue to process its aftershocks throughout the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.

For the first three weeks of the class, we will read the three sections of the Origins along with a selection of Arendt's contemporaneous writings on issues at the heart of her study: wide-scale statelessness and forced migration; racism and imperial expansion; totalitarian propaganda and the \"holes of oblivion.\" Arendt recognized that the Origins posed a question that remained unanswered in that work: faced with the manufacture of living corpses, what preserves our humanity and redeems our actions? Arendt's next major work, The Human Condition, thus moves toward an analysis of the conditions and modes of human activity: from the biological life process, to the world-creating capacity of homo faber, to the urgency and fragility of human action. As we read The Human Condition, which seeks to answer the question posed by the Origins by accounting for what European philosophy has generally failed to analyze with sufficient clarity—namely, the dimensions of the \"active life\"—we examine Arendt's attempt in the same period to review and, in her own way, deconstruct the concepts of thinking around which the ideal of a \"contemplative life\" concretized. This prepares us for a reading in the final weeks of the seminar of Eichmann in Jerusalem, where Arendt re-conceptualizes evil as a certain implementation of systematic thoughtlessness. As we examine these three major works, each of which is a reflection on the relation between language and politics, we will continually attend to the varying ways in which Arendt sought to understand where poetry stands in relation to human \"conditionality,\" and we will use her often-neglected suggestions in this regard to develop an Arendtian poetics."],["Class Materials (Required)","Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (any edition) Arendt, The Human Condition (any edition) Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem (any edition) Additional texts available on Canvas"]]}]},{"i":"014180","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in Literary Theory & Criticism","u":"ENGLISH","n":"481-0","s":[{"i":"014180-20","r":[{"n":"James Joseph Hodge","p":"847 4915675","a":"University Hall Room 408"}],"t":"Studies in Literary Theory & Criticism","k":"Technologies of the Self","u":"ENGLISH","n":"481-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 3622"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":3,"p":[["Overview of class","The History of Media Technologies and English This seminar examines the late twentieth- and twenty-first century emergence and saturation of contemporary culture by personalized electronic and computational technologies, primarily in the Anglophone West.

We will examine congressional acts ranging from the 1906 Antiquities Act, 1916 National Parks Act, to the 1978 Archeological Resource Protection Act, 1990 Native American Graves and Protection and Repatriation Act, Traditional Cultural Properties and Landscapes, and National Heritage Corridors. We will discuss the ethics and moral decision making that goes into these laws and the issues that arise with legislation and enforcement of cultural preservation."]]},{"i":"018572-22","r":[{"n":"William Charles Geoffrey Burns","p":"650.281.9126","a":"1808 Chicago Avenue","o":"call or email"}],"t":"Special Topics in Environmental Policy and Culture","k":"International Environmental Law and Policy","u":"ENVR_POL","n":"390-0","s":"22","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Harris Hall L28"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":30,"p":[["Overview of class","Global environmental problems, including the looming threat of climate change, the biodiversity crisis, and increasing pressures on ocean ecosystems due to human activities, have become pressing concerns in recent decades. In response, a sophisticated architecture of global governance has emerged, including through the establishment of hundreds of multi-lateral treaties to confront these threats. As a consequence, nation-States have begun to cooperate with each other to an unprecedented extent, although not without facing significant obstacles, and not without domestic political agendas sometimes delaying or thwarting progress at the international level. This class examines the array of legal regimes, politics, governance processes and policy tools that have emerged in the arena of global environmental law and politics. We will focus on a number of different discrete international environmental problems, as well as how international environmental law is formulated and enforced at the international level. Assignments will include drafting of UN resolutions and simulated UN General Assembly \"debates\" and a mid-term examination.

At the same time, volunteering has become a significant issue of public debate, as unintended consequences of people's best intentions are brought to light in the popular press and in academic literature. This class explores the ethics of altruism through the discourses and practices that make up volunteering and voluntourism, from the perspectives of volunteers, hosts, and a range of others both promoting and critiquing volunteerism. What motivates people to volunteer among strangers or in unfamiliar contexts, and what are the implications of these voluntary exchanges for the volunteers, and for the communities and institutions where volunteering takes place? What are the ethics and values that make up \"making a difference\" among differently-situated players involved in volunteering? Given that volunteers often act upon best intentions, what are the logics and values that justify altruistic action, and the differential standards by which volunteers are judged based on where they go and how they engage in volunteering? What kinds of unintended consequences come about through voluntary action?

Beginning in the 1990s with the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Berlin, the city quickly became home to cutting-edge DJs, party planners, club owners, and dancers, including notorious clubs like Tresor and Berghain. Coming together, they pioneered new ways to express oneself and connect with one another through music and dance. This course examines many aspects of this culture, from the unique genres of music and how DJs create music to the technology of sound, the experience of dancing and of clubs as spaces, and the politics of belonging, representation, and identity on the dance floor, in particular its complicated exchanges with Black communities and music in Chicago and Detroit, the birthplaces of this music. We also will consider the social, cultural, and political implications of nightlife and dance music as a site of community-building, friendship, and love within contemporary Western society, especially for queer communities.

The primary aim of the course is for students to understand the complexity and indeed disunity of this movement and the ways in which it evolved, from the early twentieth century up to its violent suppression under Nazism, in relation to the interpretations and motivations of its practitioners as well as to the different uses to which its signature ideas and images were put.\n\tStudents will learn about the historical and social contexts out of which German Expressionism arose, in particular, the rapid technological modernization and demographic and social changes of German-speaking countries in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will also learn about the cultural and social shifts that occurred during and in the wake of the First World War and how this affected the German-speaking world in general, and Expressionism as both ideology and art form in particular. Students will consequently be able to understand the complex relationship between aesthetic practices and social phenomena, and be able to contextualize ideas about art as well as artistic products in relation to their historical emergence.\n\tOn the example of German Expressionism, students will understand and appreciate concerns relating to modernist or avant-garde movements in art and cultural production generally, and learn about the various motivations, hopes, and dreams behind early twentieth-century calls for a revolution in artistic form. Students will also learn about the decisive development of early German cinema, and be able to track the changes in content, function, and reception that occur in the shift between genres, media, and technological possibilities.\n\tStudents will learn about the so-called \"Expressionism debate\" of the 1930s and beyond, in which Expressionism's relationship to a then-nascent fascism was at issue, and will be able to formulate a cogent and founded position in regard to this debate as well as to the larger political implications of Expressionism as an artistic and cultural movement, with an eye towards the complexities of artistic form and the relationship of art to politics more generally. ADVANCED EXPRESSION \tAll of the class discussion, readings, and writing assignments for this course are in German, at an advanced level. Through written assignments in analytical close reading, supplemented by creative assignments, students will gain greater facility in written German, and develop a more sophisticated understanding of both the German language and the protocols of expository writing in general.

At the same time, however, \"freedom\" is a thoroughly ambiguous and dubious word that, from the beginning of its function as a basic concept, contained implicit and explicit programs for new forms of domination, including domination in the relation of the self to itself, to the world, and to others. For this reason, a critique of freedom is necessary.\nThe seminar will focus on the idea that freedom exists only in becoming, that is, as \"liberation.\" For it is precisely this idea of liberation that underlies the dominant narratives of post-classical Western culture (and modernity in particular): liberation defines its notions of history, subjectivity, education, politics, the arts, etc. And it is therefore also the thought and process of liberation that most clearly exhibits the dialectical knot that links freedom and domination in their contradiction. From this perspective, processes of liberation will be examined in the seminar. We will ask, for example: what drives those processes? How do they proceed? How do they fail and/or how do they establish new orders of domination? The seminar will pursue these questions by examining a variety of methodological approaches. These include the following: the exploration of the putative Greek origin of Western freedom in the history of ideas (Meier, Patterson, Raaflaub); the systematic conceptualization of the relations between freedom, capacity, and habit (Arendt, Hegel); the psycho-social analysis of the entanglement between emancipation and domination (Fanon, Hartman); the relation between experience and liberation in aesthetic theories of freedom (Adorno, Blanchot, Heidegger, Nancy); and the question of the relation between religion and freedom (Lévinas, Santner)."]]}]},{"i":"002023","c":"WCAS","t":"Independent Reading","u":"GERMAN","n":"490-0","s":[{"i":"002023-23","t":"Independent Reading","u":"GERMAN","n":"490-0","s":"23","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":15}]},{"i":"024795","c":"WCAS","t":"College Seminar","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"101-7","s":[{"i":"024795-1","r":[{"n":"Amy Ruth Partridge","p":"847.491.5872"}],"t":"College Seminar","k":"Coalitional Politics","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"101-7","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["University Library 3370"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["NO DATA","NO DATA"]]}]},{"i":"020249","c":"WCAS","t":"Sexual Subjects: Introduction to Sexuality Studies","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"220-0","s":[{"i":"020249-20","r":[{"n":"Lane Fenrich","p":"8474917560","a":"1922 Sheridan Rd."}],"t":"Sexual Subjects: Introduction to Sexuality Studies","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"220-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Lutkin Hall"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":90,"p":[["Overview of class","This interdisciplinary introductory lecture/discussion course surveys the sprawling topics of sex, sexuality, and sexuality studies.

This class will investigate how gender shapes politics and policy, and how these in turn shape gender, primarily in the United States. I aim also to provide comparative and global context. Gender is conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, always constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We will analyze the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"\"top down\"\" and \"\"bottom up\"\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? And how has anti-feminism come to be a significant dimension of politics? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to modern women's movements. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. We examine some of the gendered aspects of the political landscape in the contemporary United States, with class input on which issues to explore.

Demonstrate how public policies and political processes shape gendered relations, and question the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic right.

In this class students will learn the future tense forms, the imperative and the conditional forms, advanced connectors (such as לכן, מפני ש..., בגלל), impersonal phrases with infinitive forms, more prepositions, the condensed form of possessive. Students will also expand their cultural proficiency by learning and practicing various everyday experiences like going to the doctor, buying clothes or electronics in the store, preparing for a trip, going to a concert, volunteering, or taking care of pets. The class will be built around the topic of leisure and hobbies, and the grammatical structures will be introduced and practiced through the various sub-topics we will learn about such as trips, favorite tv shows, movies and music, students' hobbies, and more.

How did past societies manage and cope with climate change? What were the consequences of climate change on past societies, from subsistence farmers and transhumance pastoralists to city-states and empires? In seeking answers to these questions, students will read, present, discuss, analyze, and debate interdisciplinary literature dealing with the impacts of climate change on the cyclical rise and fall, stress and rejuvenation, and growth and decline of several civilizations.

Instead, they are deeply political and profoundly man-made. This course adopts a historical and global approach in order to denaturalize disaster. From famines in British India to earthquakes in post-colonial Peru, from floods in New Orleans to nuclear disaster in Japan, we will see how disasters expose and exacerbate pre-existing inequalities, inflicting suffering disproportionately among those groups already marginalized by race, class, gender, geography, and age. These inequalities shape not only the impact of the disaster but the range of responses to it, including political critique and retrenchment, relief and rebuilding efforts, memorialization, and planning - or failing to plan - for future disasters of a similar kind. The course culminates in a unit on the contemporary challenge of anthropogenic global climate change, the ultimate man-made disaster.

It has been a major topic in international law, scholarly studies, and debates. However, the connection between colonialism, its legacies, and genocide has been rather neglected. Only during the last several decades scholars have started to scrutinize many cases of genocide from the perspective of colonialism and postcolonialism studies. The goal of this course is to give students the opportunity to gain wider theoretical and empirical knowledge about several genocides that took place in different parts of Africa during the 20th century as a result of the European colonial rule and of its legacy during the postcolonial era focusing mostly on the twentieth century cases of the Herero and Nama Genocide, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Genocide in Darfur. In order to provide in-depth explanations and increase knowledge about the character of colonial and postcolonial genocides, one therefore needs to place specific events in their proper historical, cultural, social, political, ideological and other contexts. After completing the course students will acquire solid knowledge about several cases of genocide, with a particular focus on the colonization processes and postcolonial struggles in Africa during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the contemporary debates on colonial genocides, prosecution, denial, and prevention."],["Learning Objectives","Familiarize yourselves with the major concepts and the cases of genocide we examine in class. Read critically, understand and analyze works of history produced by scholars with different methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of colonialism and genocide.

In a sense, however, this is nothing new: Americans have long defined themselves and their nation through changes in the material things they own, make, design, use, and trash. This class examines the debate over what America is and should be by studying its technology. Each lecture is organized around the history of a representative artifact, offering a new perspective on canonical episodes and themes in American history—and theories of technological change—right up to the present day. From the telegraph to social media, from the bicycle to SpaceX, from typing pools to algorithmic AI, Americans have identified technology as central to their personal and national destiny. The course's \"flipped classroom\" approach is echoed by its core assignment, in which students write an original research paper on the social history of an artifact of their choice.

Thus: •\tStudents analyze primary-source accounts of technological innovations and secondary-source interpretations of technological change, including theoretical approaches such as network analysis, systems theory, social construction, evolutionary theory, and affordance design, etc. Students then extend this historical understanding to the way that technological change is shaping our contemporary world, including the study of current developments like social media and AI. •\tStudents gain an appreciation for the wide range of participants who have contributed to the technological development: from indigenous peoples to hackers, and from female \"pink collar\" workers to engineers to gamers.

Their negative assessment has remained with us until the present day. This course will grapple with the both the origins of this negative bequest as well as some of the anomalies of the medieval tradition. For example, despite the insistence that heterosexuality was ordained by God, the disparagement of physicality and women led to the institutionalization of clerical celibacy in the West. This, in turn, fostered a gay subculture. Likewise, despite the theoretical insistence on a separation between the sexes that was even present in the afterlife, these same theorists not only praised \"virile women,\" but occasionally celebrated cross-dressing in female saints! This course will examine the institutions and ideas that dominated the construction of gender in the Middle Ages. It will also lend insight into not one, but many \"sexualities.\""],["Learning Objectives","Learning Objectives (HD-FS): The readings in this course introduce students to an array of primary sources: theology, canon and civil law, legal proceedings, autobiography, fiction, medical treatises, and inquisitorial manuals -- to name but a few. The diversity of these texts will provide a textured and multi-vocalic perception of the Middle Ages that resists being flattened out into a simplistic narrative. Secondary sources will be used to contextualization medieval documents and provide models for constructing historical arguments through the application of appropriate methodologies and a judicious assessment of evidence. Discussion sections will focus on primary sources. Students will engage in the joint analysis of historical documents, learning to recognize and respect the alterity of the historical past, while at the same time respecting one another. Course assignments are designed to develop students' historical skill set. The two essay assignments (ca. 5-8 pp. each) raise provocative questions to be addressed through primary sources (appropriately contextualized by secondary readings). These assignments will help foster analytical abilities, writing skills, and stimulate the historical imagination. The midterm and final exams contain broad essay questions, cultivating a capacity for historical synthesis. This course also emphasizes scholarly mechanisms for documentation, such as footnotes and bibliography. Learning Objectives (FD-SBS) Since this course spans late antiquity to the later Middle Ages (ca. 300 CE to 1400), students will learn to appreciate how change over time is variable and affected by contingencies like literacy, class, gender, as well as unconstructed realities like climate and natural disasters. Medieval Sexuality is a field of multiple contestation on both micro and macro levels, and will be assessed as such. This course will highlight the overt and covert conflicts between men and women, adults and youths, clergy and laity, parents and children, as well as celibacy and marriage. Both qualitative and quantitative sources will be enlisted to explore these tensions. The medieval church's attempt to exercise a hegemonic control over sexuality never fully succeeded. The distance between church mandated behavior and actual sexual practice will alert students to the wide gap between ideology and historical reality, and how efforts to narrow this gap resulted in the persecution of sexual minorities. Students will be encouraged to reflect upon the way in which the values of the medieval church continue to affect perceptions of gender, attitudes to sex, and institutions like marriage and the family in our own time."],["Evaluation Method","midterm (15%); 1st essay (15%); 2d essay (25%); final exam (30%); attendance and participation (15%)"]],"o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"018819-60","t":"Medieval Sex","u":"HISTORY","n":"330-0","s":"60","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Fisk Hall 217"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"018819-61","t":"Medieval Sex","u":"HISTORY","n":"330-0","s":"61","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"4","f":"4"},{"i":"018819-62","t":"Medieval Sex","u":"HISTORY","n":"330-0","s":"62","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Cent.

In this course we will interrogate and challenge Weber's thesis, exploring the ways in which the monstrous and the marvelous permeated the early modern imagination. Early modern Europeans collected and catalogued mythical beasts and natural wonders from around the globe in private collections, speculated on the divine significance of comets and earthquakes, and testified to the existence of ghosts and witches in judicial trials. Mystical visions and wondrous miracles saturated popular religious culture, gaining strength and urgency from the confessional divisions of the Reformation. Throughout this course we will be guided by a series of case studies drawn from the vast catalogue of European marvels (a woman who gave birth to a litter of rabbits in eighteenth-century London; a compendium of hybrid beasts compiled by Ambroise Paré; a mass possession among religious pilgrims in Paris; and many others). We will explore how the marvelous and the monstrous were continually reinvented to reflect broader cultural forces and political anxieties, from the rise of colonial European empires to the ascendancy of scientific attitudes among intellectual elites. In early modern Europe, wonders signaled the limits of human knowledge, blurred the boundaries between the natural and the divine, and testified to the continuing presence of the supernatural in an increasingly secularized world."],["Learning Objectives","In this course, students will: read complex texts and images \"slowly\" by summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing them in order to generate and support writing; learn to how to ask generative research questions about the past and produce complex, analytic, evidence-based historical arguments; and reflect on the history of secularization."],["Evaluation Method","Class participation, reading response papers, and final project/essay"],["Class Notes","Concentration: European"]],"o":"4"}]},{"i":"002149","c":"WCAS","t":"Research Seminar","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":[{"i":"002149-20","r":[{"n":"Dyan H Elliott","p":"847/491-7652","a":"Harris Hall Room 337"}],"t":"Research Seminar","k":"The Black Death","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L06"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Freshmen may not register for this course.","p":[["Overview of class","The fourteenth-century Black Death (or bubonic plague) has long been the benchmark against which all other disasters have been measured. Although there were devastating instances of plague in Roman times, and even isolated outbreaks in our own time, the medieval plague was a true pandemic that raged throughout the world. This courses focuses on the bubonic plague in Western Europe. After examining the first visitation of the plague in the Byzantine era (6c), we will then focus on the period between 1346 and 1348, when the Black Death wiped out somewhere between 40 and 60 percent of the population, and the aftermath. At a time when principles of contagion were hazy and medical treatment primitive, the panic-stricken society alternated between regarding the plague as evidence of God's wrath for humanity's sins and desperately seeking scapegoats to blame. This course will approach the plague from multiple perspectives through the lens of primary and secondary sources. Among the topics addressed will be: the immediate causes of the plague; medieval and modern theories of the disease; the plague's impact on both religious personnel and the secular work force; its impact on culture; the relation between plague and persecution, and violence; and the impact of the plague outside of Europe and beyond the Middle Ages."],["Learning Objectives","Learning Objectives (HD-FS): The readings in this course introduce students to an array of primary sources: theology, canon and civil law, sermons, autobiography, chronicles, medical treatises -- to name but a few. The diversity of these texts will provide a textured and multi-vocalic perception of the Black Death that resists being flattened out into a simplistic narrative. Secondary sources will be used to contextualization medieval documents and provide models for constructing historical arguments through the application of appropriate methodologies and a judicious assessment of evidence. Learning Objectives (FD-SBS) This course focuses on the fourteenth-century Black Death (the Bubonic Plague), primarily in Western Europe. This a time of unmitigated disaster. Students will learn to appreciate the relations between disease and historical contingencies like class, age, gender, warfare, the economy, and climate. We will consider the active efforts of medical, religious, and political authorities to meet the needs of a society on the brink of collapse. We will also assess the way in which disaster undermined social norms, leading to disaffection, the challenge of authority, and the scape-gating of minorities. Students will be introduced to some of the recent scientific breakthroughs in archeology and DNA analyses that have shed new light on this enigmatic period. By the end of the course, students will not only be familiar with a watershed moment in western history from multiple perspectives, but will also come to a greater understanding of how societies in general respond to natural disasters."],["Evaluation Method","Identification of research topic (4-5 pp., 5%); short proposal or abstract (6-8 pp. + annotated bibliography, 10%); draft (15 %); final research paper (20 pp. + notes and bibliography, 50%); participation and oral presentations (20%)"]],"o":"4"},{"i":"002149-22","r":[{"n":"Shireen Hamza"}],"t":"Research Seminar","k":"Podcasting the History of Science","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":"22","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall L05"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Freshmen may not register for this course.","p":[["Overview of class","Instructor: Shireen Hamza This course will provide students with the opportunity to create a podcast on the history of science together.

We will read selected works to consider the methodologies that historians have used to study the movement of people in the modern world, as well as the political, cultural, and economic implications of those movements. As we discover how states have repeatedly used migration as a resource and constructed it as a threat, we will also pay careful attention to how historians have tried to use their knowledge in contemporary political debates, reading public history projects and editorials alongside academic articles and monographs. We will consider questions such as: • What are the historical processes that explain migration patterns? Are migration and migration restriction intrinsically linked to one another? • How are scholars globalizing what began as a Eurocentric field, and specifically an Atlantic-centric field? What are productive conversations that can be had between scholars who work on migration in different parts of the world? • What productive conversations can be had about migration across disciplines?

This fall course returns to the work of academic historians who have and continue to transform what we know about the history of African Americans and the United States. Open to historians and non-historians, this course will center works that use historical methods to uncover US histories of enslaved and free people of African descent and their experiences and shaping of institutions such as slavery, freedom, the US legal system, structures and ideologies of gender and sexuality, political activism against slavery and for the development of racial equality; and others, between the Revolutionary Era (inclusive of the \"American\" Revolution but also the revolutions in human equality in the Atlantic World); and the American Civil War. Students will be expected to read the works to apprehend several levels of knowledge. A) Historical facts and ideas. What are the important people, places and historical contexts explored by the works under discussion? How do we understand and apprehend specific historical contexts in the past, and how they differ from the present? B) Discussions and Debates among Historians about historical contexts and ideas. Where have historians agreed and disagreed about interpretations of historical events, people and places? How do the works we're reading argue for a specific view of history that differs from what has gone before, or lead us to ask new questions? C) Sources, Research, and Argumentation. How do academic historians conduct research and writing? What are the parameters of academic historical research and writing generally, and specifically in terms of African American history?"],["Learning Objectives","Graduate level understanding of African American history and historiography."],["Evaluation Method","Review essays; regular class participation; presentation(s)."]]},{"i":"002203-24","r":[{"n":"Helen Louise Tilley","p":"847/467-3014","a":"Harris Hall - Room 335"}],"t":"Topics in History","k":"Global History of Science, Medicine and Environmen","u":"HISTORY","n":"492-0","s":"24","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Harris Hall room 101"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","This seminar examines the historical geography of science, technology, and medicine, focusing especially on cross-cultural entanglements over the last five hundred years.

What Science Can't Teach Us: A Humanities Approach to Making Sense of the World The great political theorist Isaiah Berlin once said that there is an old quarrel between two rival ways of knowing the world: a paradigmatically scientific form of knowledge that is produced by methodical, systematic inquiry, and a more impalpable alternative that has been variously characterized as good judgment, wisdom, or art. In this course we will be examining various oppositions related to this rivalry, like the distinction between theoretical and practical knowledge, between empiricism and aesthetics, between reason and emotion, and between fact and value. One major aim of this course is to use these oppositions to help explore some differences between the sciences and the humanities. It is often taken for granted that the natural sciences aim at knowledge that is theoretical, empirical, rational, and fact-based; but there is much less certainty about whether the humanities should be guided by the same paradigm of knowledge, or whether it would be better served by adopting a fundamentally different conception of its aims and methods. Are there distinctively literary or aesthetic ways of knowing, different from the sciences? What do arts, practices, feelings and values teach us that knowledge cannot? We will pursue these questions by engaging both literary and philosophical texts. Course enhancement possibilities We anticipate inviting scholars to the class to reflect on the nature of research in humanities, and we also hope to arrange a visit to a museum or two to explore the unique epistemological problems posed by the visual arts: How are museums organized differently, either to present knowledge or stimulate aesthetic appreciation?

Science Fiction and Detective Literature: Popular Genres in the Global South Science fiction and detective literature are genres whose formulaic nature has often been derided or ignored by literary critics. Yet the very formal structures of these genres may be part of the key to their popularity and increasing ubiquitousness. Emerging in England in the nineteenth century from, in part, an urban unease brought on by the colonial encounter, the detective novel form was quickly \"translated\" back into colonized territories, soon becoming one of the most truly transnational literary genres in the world. Similarly, while science fiction's early narratives drew from the scenarios and power dynamics of the colonial encounter, it has more recently become a space from which to contest official histories as well as posit decolonial futures. Focusing on the spaces of the Global South, late colonial and postcolonial South Asia and (post)colonial Latin America in particular, this course will trace how and why these popular genres have emerged as a mode of narration with which to confront political and social transformations and contemporary crises.

A Place Called Home: Great Migrations, Folk Life, and The Chicago Renaissance \"By the time the Great Migration was over,\" writes Isabel Wilkerson in the epilogue to her sprawling \"epic story\" The Warmth of Other Suns, \"few Americans had not been touched by it.\" From World War I through the end of the Vietnam War, African Americans kept coming out of the American South, to the North and West, mostly to cities like Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Tulsa, Cleveland, Detroit, Wichita, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Like many other migrants and immigrants, they were often obstructed, misrepresented, and rebuked on the beginnings and ends (not to mention in the middles) of their trips. Yet they kept coming, and their movement, as well as its aftermath, culturally redefined the United States, along with the migrants themselves. This seminar will be an intensive, interdisciplinary study of literature, music, film, and visual art produced during and about the first and second waves of the Great Migration, from roughly 1917 until 1970. We will explore the Chicago Renaissance as a cultural flowering of the Migration's first wave, and consider the philosophical and cultural critiques offered by the African American intelligentsia of the period. In addition, we will examine the migration of Black Folklife—faith practices, music, foodways, and vernacular iterations—and chart its impacts across and beyond the US. Finally, the class will explore what some sociologists and urban studies scholars have called a \"reverse migration,\" citing a statistical exodus of African Americans out of the Great Migration's destination cities in numbers that now rival or exceed the movement itself. We will also focus on themes of home, community, and physical place and space, ideas that we imagine will be especially resonant for first-year students. Possible excursions and course enhancements Chicago will provide an important site, connection, and laboratory for the course; we anticipate availing students of local institutions and archives including the Black Metropolis Research Consortium <https://bmrc.lib.uchicago.edu/>, the South Side Community Art Center <http://www.sscartcenter.org/>, and the Rebuild Foundation<https://rebuild-foundation.org/>.

A major reason for this interest was the cynical account of human nature, morals and politics promoted by Thomas Hobbes and Bernard de Mandeville: that human beings are solely motivated by self-interest, and that morals and politics are merely tools of social control, aimed to limit and redirect self-promoting human impulses. Many thinkers argued in response that human attractions to beauty and art were powerful counterexamples to that portrayal of human nature, showing that human beings can love objects and others for their own sakes, and in a way that calls them to social harmony, perhaps through eliciting sympathetic responsiveness. In this course, we will read and talk about central texts and issues in this discussion, moving from Mandeville's Fable of the Bees to several major responses to his cynical challenge in the British aesthetics tradition: Shaftesbury's high-minded view of beauty as rational order eliciting disinterested pleasure; Hutcheson's theory of humor as cognitive and morally corrective (not mockery or ridicule); Kames' view of art, including tragedy, as arousing sympathetic emotional responses; and Adam Smith's and Sophie de Grouchy's views of art, morality, and politics as grounded in sympathetic imagination. In addition to discussing their claims concerning the importance of art for understanding human nature and morality, we will discuss questions such as: does appreciation of art and beauty require education, or contribute to moral and political education, or both? How does representational art (\"imitation\") arouse sympathetic emotion or understanding of diverse others? How is taste (for beauty or art) influenced by wealth, social class, or national identity?"],["Learning Objectives","* To attain a grasp of central positions, arguments and debates in eighteenth-century British philosophy, concerning aesthetic value and its relation to moral and political values. *To explore these theoretical claims, through applying them to selected works of art or objects of beauty *To examine, expand upon, or criticize these claims, through critical discussion and writing that tests the reasoning made in support of them"],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be based on class participation, short writing assignments, video presentation and discussion board responses to others' presentations, and two papers."],["Class Materials (Required)","Readings will be selections from the following, available in a reader for purchase at Quartet: Sophie de Grouchy, Letters on Sympathy; Francis Hutcheson, \"Reflections on Laughter\"; Lord Kames (Henry Home), \"Of Our Attachment to Objects of Distress\" and Elements of Criticism; Shaftesbury (Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of), Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Morals; Adam Smith, \"Of the Nature of Imitation which Takes Place in What are Called the Imitative Arts\" and Theory of Moral Sentiments"],["Class Materials (Suggested)","If class participants wish to read more widely, around the selections, they may wish to purchase the following works: Anthony Ashley Cooper (Earl of Shaftesbury), Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, Liberty Fund 978-0-86597-294-0 Sophie de Grouchy, Letters on Sympath, trans.

Archaeologists, intellectuals, and imperial authorities worked together in the assemblage of important collections of all kinds of objects and treasures to be shipped, studied, and exhibited in Europe. Under the premise of scientific inquiry, a Western authorized network of experts and institutions provided the legal and academic framework to justify the permanency of those collections in European and North American soil. After World War II, the rise of UNESCO and the origin of the concept of \"World Heritage\" drastically transformed the ways of relating to cultural heritage and the notions of legal and historical ownership, favoring the European custody of spoiled collections. Nowadays, contemporary attempts by communities of former colonies to reclaim stolen objects have destabilized these authorized discourses of heritage. The course will explore the relationship and interaction between the Global North and the Global South around the categories of cultural heritage, particularly through the ongoing debates surrounding the repatriation of objects and collections from elite museums and institutions in Europe and North America to Latin America and Africa. Through several case studies including the Benin bronzes, the Quimbaya treasure, and the Parthenon marbles among others, students will be encouraged to critically engage with current discussions on heritage and museum studies, decolonial theory and international politics and diplomacy, as to find and do research on cases of their own interest from around the world."]]}]},{"i":"017517","c":"WCAS","t":"Honors Seminar","u":"INTL_ST","n":"398-1","s":[{"i":"017517-1","r":[{"n":"Elizabeth S Hurd","a":"Scott, #209"}],"t":"Honors Seminar","u":"INTL_ST","n":"398-1","s":"1","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"THE","a":20}]},{"i":"018557","c":"WCAS","t":"Topics in Contemporary Energy and Climate Change","u":"ISEN","n":"410-0","s":[{"i":"018557-20","r":[{"n":"Yarrow Larue Axford","a":"Technological Institute F394/F395","o":"axford@northwestern.edu"}],"t":"Topics in Contemporary Energy and Climate Change","u":"ISEN","n":"410-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Technological Institute F285"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration reserved for Graduate students in all disciplines or seniors majoring in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Math, EPS, Biol Anthro, Mat Sci, Chem Eng, Mech Eng, Civ Eng, Envir Eng, Envr Sci, or Electrical Eng."}]},{"i":"018835","c":"WCAS","t":"NUvention: Energy","u":"ISEN","n":"420-0","s":[{"i":"018835-20","r":[{"n":"Mark W Werwath"},{"n":"Ian Zachary Hoopes Wiese"}],"t":"NUvention: Energy","u":"ISEN","n":"420-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["Ford Hive Rm 2350"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":30}]},{"i":"003078","c":"WCAS","t":"Elementary Italian","u":"ITALIAN","n":"101-1","s":[{"i":"003078-20","r":[{"n":"Daniela Pozzi Pavan","p":"847/467-1448","a":"1860 S.

The poem is both an adventure story and an exhaustive, assessment of the state of politics, society, religion, literature, philosophy, and theology at the beginning of the fourteenth century. This course examines a selection of the Divine Comedy's cantos in their cultural, social and political context. In particular we will explore how the world imagined by the poet relates to late medieval life and culture. A guiding concern of the discussion is to assess the ways in which Dante changed our understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine, justice and love, will and reason, happiness and knowledge, literature and the Bible. Political turmoil, philosophical and theological paradigms social and religious conflict all converge in the making of Comedy and will thus form crucial elements of our investigation.

This course observes and discusses various depictions of the notion of \"love\" from the early 20th century onwards, as captured in Hebrew novels, short stories, films, and other cultural representations. What stories do Hebrew and Israeli culture tell us about love? What kinds of love (and sexualities) does it portray? And why does it seem that even the greatest love stories must be painful and complicated? Throughout the course we will explore and examine different aspects of the cultural formation of love in Hebrew literature and Israeli culture. We will discuss notions such as the eruption of love and its decline; the myth of love; the diasporic Jewish men's complex attitude toward Eros and the suffering of the abandoned wives of the shtetl; the gendered roles and power relations; the queer alternatives of love; and postmodern love. Moreover, we will adopt close reading practices in order to critically read and interpret different literary texts from different perspectives and prisms - social, political, historical and cultural. The literary and cultural texts will be accompanied by theoretical essays - mainly psychoanalytical, feminist, and queer - as we will discuss and investigate the potentiality of bringing together literature and theory. While focusing on the concept of love, this course also provides an introduction to Hebrew literature and Israeli culture. During the course, we will read literary texts from Yosef Haim Brenner, Dvora Baron, Yehudit Hendel, David Grossman, Orly Castel-Bloom, Alon Hilu and others. We will also watch some recent Israeli films/TV shows. No previous knowledge of Hebrew, Israel or Judaism is required!

A great number of studies have been devoted to understand the nature of syntactic operations and they have been crucially looking at the interaction of these operations with the locality constraints. However, in this direction of research, the nature of islands has been relatively disregarded for a long time. Although Ross's studies have revealed which domains are islands and which are not, the question why islands are islands and non-islands are not islands has remained unanswered except for a few studies (Chomsky 1986, Lasnik & Saito 1992, Rizzi 1991 and others). Even these attempts are facing serious challenges once we start looking at wide varieties of cross-linguistic data.

Its origins date to the late 19th century, but a wave of research activity since the 1970s was partially inspired by the computation and visualization abilities of emerging computer technology. This course will focus on discrete dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. We will start with the examples of the shift map, the tent map, and the logistic family to introduce the concept of chaos, and explore further properties of chaotic behaviors through Lyapunov exponents, conjugacy, and bifurcations. Additional topics to be covered include fractals, self-similar dimensions, complex dynamics, and an exploration of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. We will also make frequent use of computation technology to augment our understanding and inspire our mathematical investigations. The prerequisite of this course is a course in linear algebra. The course will also assume some familiarity with computer programming, and many of the homework assignments will involve simple programming in Mathematica."],["Class Materials (Required)","978-0883857939 Discovering Discrete Dynamical Systems\nAuthor: Aimee Johnson\nMAA Press"],["Class Materials (Suggested)","No suggested materials.

The general area was determined in coversation with some students, but if you have a strong desire for a nearby topic we may be able to accommodate. Rules of the game: student presentations must provide context and must contain concrete examples to illustrate the main principles (speakers will not be allowed to \"not have time\" to get to the examples!). The subjects will be cluster varieties, knots, and their relation to physics. Some promising models of string theory reduce in four dimensions to N=1 or N=2 supersymmetric theories. These theories have \"BPS states\" with enhanced symmetries, whose enumeration and interaction can often be described mathematically, and often in more ways than one, leading to dualities. Notable BPS states are \"branes.\" Categories of branes and their moduli of objects play a key role in elucidating the mathematical structure from physical theoreis. For us, the mathematical stand-in for brane categories will be categories of constructible sheaves with singular support defined by a Legendrian variety --- for example, the boundary of a knot conormal. These categories are invariants of the Legendrian up to Legendrian isotopy. Foundational work on the above mathematics was provided by Kashiwara, Schapira and Guillermou. We will be more concerned with various applications, where moduli of objects can be identified with various cluster varieties, especially those of Fock and Goncharov. Here are some topics that students might explore. A main goal of the course will be to thread them together. * DT invariants of quivers (mathematically and as an effective theory of intersecting branes -- various papers, e.g. Kontsevich-Soibelman [COHA] and Cordoba-Cecotii-Vafa, others )\n* Cluster varieties and their quantization, especially those of Fock-Goncharov: framed local systems on surfaces.

How did immigration, globalization, Islamic revival and violent extremism and securitization policies reshape the political and religious landscape of Muslim-majority nations as well as in non-Muslim countries? What does the study of political Islam teach us about the relationship between religious and politics in the modern world? The course is divided in three parts. In Part 1, we focus on the politics of Islamic revival through the trajectories of various Islamic political movements in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to understand the origins of the rise of political Islam and its national, regional and global impact. In Part 2, we turn to transnational Muslim networks and connections to explore the main issues around global political Islam in its various forms including violent Islamic extremism, Sufism, piety movements, economic networks. We discuss also anti-Muslim violence and its origins.

It concerns when information is guaranteed to be true because of how it is related to other true information. To learn a logic is to learn a formal language with its own rules (like a math or programming language), and to develop skill using this formal language. A logic is then used to figure out whether arguments are good or bad in roughly two steps. First, the argument is represented in a logic. Second, the argument is assessed by seeing whether it is constructed in a way where the argument's conclusion follows. Good arguments are structured so that their conclusions are guaranteed to be true when the premises are true; bad arguments are not. In this course, you will learn two logics: truth-functional logic and first-order logic. Truth-functional logic concerns arguments involving \"and,\" \"or,\" \"if,\" and \"not.\" First-order logic builds on truth-functional logic to concern complex arguments involving \"every\", \"none,\" and \"some.\" Since this course satisfies the FD-EDR degree requirement, students should expect a rigorous class with weekly assignments and quizzes."],["Learning Objectives","To develop competence with truth-functional and first-order logic."],["Evaluation Method","Final exam -in class"],["Class Materials (Required)","All class materials will be available on Canvas at NO cost to the student."],["Class Notes","Final exam- in class"]],"o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-60","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"60","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 305"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-61","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"61","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":9,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-420"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-62","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"62","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-440"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-63","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"63","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Locy Hall 106"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-64","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"64","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["Fisk Hall 114"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"},{"i":"002599-65","t":"Elementary Logic I","u":"PHIL","n":"150-0","s":"65","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"2","f":"2"}]},{"i":"002602","c":"WCAS","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":[{"i":"002602-61","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"61","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Parkes Hall 223"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"5","f":"5"},{"i":"002602-62","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"62","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-343"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"5","f":"5"},{"i":"002602-63","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"63","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-325"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"5","f":"5"},{"i":"002602-64","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"64","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 3-410"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"5","f":"5"},{"i":"002602-X60","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"X60","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["NO DATA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"5","f":"5"},{"i":"002602-X65","t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"X65","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["NO DATA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"DIS","o":"5","f":"5"},{"i":"002602-20","r":[{"n":"Claudia Yau"}],"t":"History of Philosophy - Ancient","u":"PHIL","n":"210-1","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Harris Hall 107"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"LEC","a":80,"p":[["Overview of class","What makes a person's life go well?

Is there historical progress, and if so, of what sort? Is there a central defining subject matter or \"spine\" for human history (such as political events, technology, cultures)? Relatedly, we will also discuss questions - of philosophical anthropology, one might say -- that occupy these early thinkers concerning the relationship between history and nature, freedom, and rationality. For example: is human history to be understood as part of or continuous with natural history (of all organisms, or of human organisms in particular)? Is historical investigation therefore strongly akin to biological explanation, or based upon biological premises? Or does human freedom or rationality disrupt the claims of biology and nature - so that history (proper) is departure from nature, a break with (merely) biological processes? What, most broadly, makes human beings historical? Finally, we will also consider why these philosophers present their claims concerning human nature (philosophical anthropology) in speculative-historical, narrative form: what sorts of philosophical claims or projects might be promoted by this form of philosophizing? We will consider how these projects in philosophy of history may be connected to the philosophers' criticisms of the European colonial project and (related) European racist theorizing (historically contemporary to their work).

At the same time, however, \"freedom\" is a thoroughly ambiguous and dubious word that, from the beginning of its function as a basic concept, contained implicit and explicit programs for new forms of domination, including domination in the relation of the self to itself, to the world, and to others. For this reason, a critique of freedom is necessary.\nThe seminar will focus on the idea that freedom exists only in becoming, that is, as \"liberation.\" For it is precisely this idea of liberation that underlies the dominant narratives of post-classical Western culture (and modernity in particular): liberation defines its notions of history, subjectivity, education, politics, the arts, etc. And it is therefore also the thought and process of liberation that most clearly exhibits the dialectical knot that links freedom and domination in their contradiction. From this perspective, processes of liberation will be examined in the seminar. We will ask, for example: what drives those processes? How do they proceed? How do they fail and/or how do they establish new orders of domination? The seminar will pursue these questions by examining a variety of methodological approaches. These include the following: the exploration of the putative Greek origin of Western freedom in the history of ideas (Meier, Patterson, Raaflaub); the systematic conceptualization of the relations between freedom, capacity, and habit (Arendt, Hegel); the psycho-social analysis of the entanglement between emancipation and domination (Fanon, Hartman); the relation between experience and liberation in aesthetic theories of freedom (Adorno, Blanchot, Heidegger, Nancy); and the question of the relation between religion and freedom (Lévinas, Santner)."],["Class Materials (Required)","Readings will be available on Canvas."]]}]},{"i":"015844","c":"WCAS","t":"Seminar in German Philosophy","u":"PHIL","n":"414-0","s":[{"i":"015844-20","r":[{"n":"Pascal Brixel"}],"t":"Seminar in German Philosophy","u":"PHIL","n":"414-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge 3438 Philosophy Sem.

Consideration of the Iraq War (2003-2011) focuses on the development of counterinsurgency and the emergence of multi-domain warfare (i.e., political warfare, information warfare, etc.) and increased reliance on low-profile Special Operations Forces. Our attention then turns to recent challenges of hybrid warfare (i.e., hacking and fake news and their roles in conflicts), and the advent of flexible responses such as increased American reliance on drones and contractors in the conduct of warfare.

This means that you should leave this class with the ability to think, write, and speak about political theories and their relation to laws and legal obligations, as well as strategies for supporting, challenging, or resisting prevailing political intuitions and their institutionalization. You should be able to understand and defend your own interpretations of political conflicts, violence, and law. To do so will require you to become familiar with key historical events relevant to contemporary debates about the rule of law, speech, and religion, to which much of the lectures will be devoted. Assigned readings include works by Plato, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Rosa Luxemburg, Frantz Fanon, and Carole Pateman. Please note: this class requires you read about 100 pages of political theory weekly, on average. This is a course for those who enjoy reading and discussing challenging texts. The authors assigned for this class wrote in very different times and contexts, and had different political priorities.

I aim also to provide comparative and global context. Gender is conceptualized as a set of relations, identities and cultural schema, always constituted with other dimensions of power, difference and inequality (e.g., race, class, sexuality, religion, citizenship status). We will analyze the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. What do states do, via institutions of political participation and representation, citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? And how has anti-feminism come to be a significant dimension of politics? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to modern women's movements. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. We examine some of the gendered aspects of the political landscape in the contemporary United States, with class input on which issues to explore.

Why do governments choose to protect some industries behind high tariff walls while leaving others exposed to the vagaries of international competition? Why do most countries in the world rely on the U.S. dollar for their primary reserve currency - and will the dollar continue to serve that function? Why have many countries removed barriers to cross-border financial flows - and what are the social and political consequences of global financial market openness? Does international trade and investment make military conflict less or more likely? Do economic sanctions even work? How have the series of economic crises over the past decade - the 2008-09 financial market meltdown in the U.S., the global credit crunch the followed, sovereign debt crises (in the Eurozone countries and elsewhere), and the severe, synchronized economic downturns that followed the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic - shifted the distribution of global economic and political power? In this course we will develop an analytical toolkit to provide some insight into these and other questions, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with two types of evidence: qualitative and historical and quantitative and cross-national.

This seminar is designed to introduce students to classic theoretical issues, consider evidence from diverse methodological approaches, and to spark new ideas for research. In this project-based seminar, students will identify new research questions and develop experimental designs to address them. In the first weeks, the professor will cover background information and lead discussion to set students on a path to success in developing their new projects. Then, working collaboratively in small teams and with hands-on support from the professor, students will develop proposals for a new research project in three different topical areas in language, cognitive and social development. For each selected topical area, students will be introduced to a curated set of readings These will feature an outstanding recent review, along with related primary source materials.

Using a range of creative assignments and multi-modal interdisciplinary sources, we will approach the body and space as places where learning happens, and therefore as categories through which we can analyze how learning happens, including in our very own classroom and on campus. Students will learn to ask how the body shapes and is shaped by its learning environment through categories like gender/sex and sexuality, race/ethnicity and religion, ability and access, and how fields like architecture, design, technology and media influence the enterprise of learning. Students will learn to re-examine their most basic assumptions about learning in a variety of expected and unexpected settings, like libraries and maker spaces, rabbinic bathrooms and football fields, science labs and ancient Greek life, in order to prepare for a range of learning experiences that they may encounter at Northwestern, and beyond. The course will guide students to be more attuned to the social and material dynamics that may otherwise go unrecognized in these experiences, teaching critical skills that will prepare them to be more conscious learners. It will appeal to students with a wide-range of academic interests across the humanities, arts and sciences, and to anyone interested in asking big questions about learning through different time periods and fields of study."]]},{"i":"024808-21","r":[{"n":"Ashley Helen-Louise King"}],"t":"College Seminar","k":"Queer Religion","u":"RELIGION","n":"101-7","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Shepard Hall Classroom B05"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","About half of LGBTQ+ Americans identify as religious, though their stories may be less familiar to us than stories of religious oppression and acrimony.

Does it have to be? This course explores how queer religious people in America, past and present, have made sense of their lives as queer and religious. We will ask how religion has shaped queer people's self-understanding as queer, and how queerness has shaped their understanding of faith through their stories of coming out, conversion, transition, diaspora, desire, loss, and healing from spiritual trauma. We will identify the many contributions queer people have made to American religious history—sometimes while hiding their rainbow under a bushel. Course materials comprise multiple genres of academic writing (history, theory, theology, ethnography, and cultural criticism) and popular media (memoir, fiction, film, podcasts, music, and social media), drawn from Native American religions, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Haitian Vodou, and New Age spiritualities like tarot and astrology.

We explore the major doctrinal varieties of Buddhism, from its inception through the rise of the Mahayana and Tantric or Vajrayana traditions. At the same time, we also investigate Buddhist visual, material, and ritual cultures—which offer windows onto aspects of Buddhism as a lived religion not always visible in scriptural sources. In the process we engage themes like the meaning of suffering, the cosmology of cyclical rebirth, the social role of monasticism and its intervention in traditional family structures, the place of women and gender in Buddhism, the relationship between religious ideals and everyday life, the question of self-reliance versus divine assistance, and the power of images and icons. Our readings of primary sources offer close engagement with Buddhist ideas and practices, allowing us to understand how the religion shaped the ways people in pre-modern Asia saw and interacted with their worlds.

We will explore the beginnings of the scholarly legal tradition, its relationship with Hindu statecraft (arthaśāstra), its interaction with other legal systems of South Asia, its role in colonial administration, and its ultimate replacement by modern Indian law. Our investigation will focus on the formal features of Hindu law while placing it in a broader historical and cultural perspective. To this end, we will explore the relationship between the scholarly tradition and law in practice, the relationship between Brahmanism, law, and politics, and the role of caste and gender in the formation of Hindu law.

Some pursued supernatural longevity and even immortality through various regimes of self-cultivation. Others, by contrast, renounced the body in part or whole through dramatic acts of self-immolation. Even in death, however, many aspired to rebirth in heavenly realms where bodies do not grow old and die, but rather live forever in bliss. This course examines these various attempts to overcome death in Chinese religion—including Buddhism, Daoism, and traditions that fall between these large categories—seeking to understand how the mortality of the body was used to authorize particular modes of embodied living. In the process, we will explore how these modes of religious life shaped attitudes toward food, medicine, gender, sexuality, and family.

How do saintly people interact with their bodies? What do modern celebrities like Beyonce and Tupac Shakur have in common with the saints? Why is there a patron saint of stomachaches? This course explores the complex relationship between saints and their bodies in Christian history. Saints have long represented the extremes of Christian excellence, in large part because their lives and bodies interrogate the boundaries between heaven and earth, spirit and flesh, masculine and feminine, holy and transgressive, life and death. Saints facilitate incredible miracles, perform painful and sometimes disgusting acts of asceticism, and experience mystically erotic relationships with the divine. Even as saints live to deny their bodies, their bodies are nevertheless foundational to their sanctity, both before and after death. In this class, we will explore how and why certain exceptional individuals came to be regarded as saints; the ways in which the body was central to living a saintly life and maintaining a connection to the world after death; how religious communities developed around saints and the body; how saints used their bodies to serve their broader communities; and how ideas about sainthood, sanctity, and the body developed in relation to changing cultural movements, social interests, and local ideals.

Although much of the course content concerns science and technology, the theoretical and analytical frameworks developed in this course are intended to apply to any domain involving knowledge, expertise, technologies, or formalized techniques. How might sociology as a field of study benefit from closer engagement both with epistemic concerns and with the material aspects of our technosocial world? We will examine: why we believe what we believe (the politics of knowledge production, circulation, and reception); the impact and uptake of technologies and the assessment of technological risks; the character of life in expert-driven \"knowledge societies\"; the resolution of conflicts around knowledge and technology (and the use of knowledge and technology in conflict resolution); the encounters between and across different knowledge systems, ways of knowing, and epistemic cultures, both locally and globally; the use of technologies to tell us \"who we are\" and \"where we belong\"; the social and technological reproduction of inequalities, including those related to social class, race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality, location in global hierarchies, etc.; the relations between activists and experts, and the tensions between expertise and democracy; the roles of social movements when intervening in debates about knowledge, science, and technology, as well as the use of knowledge and technology by social movements; and the nature of governance in technologically sophisticated societies—including the character of collective decision-making about knowledge and technology, as well as the uses of knowledge and technology to arrive at such decisions. A lot (but not all) of the course content focuses on the United States, though we will try whenever possible to place developments in a global context and we will benefit from comparative and postcolonial approaches to STS.

Do we set out to mold reality to our vision or accept it as it is? How do we forge ahead with our dreams if others do not share our values or goals? Cervantes' Don Quixote tackles these big questions in ways that are both moving and funny as it narrates the adventures of the bedraggled hero--a man driven mad by reading too many fantasy novels--and his earthy sidekick Sancho Panza. The novel contains themes that resonate with our lives today, exploring not only what it means to write--and read--fiction but also asking us to evaluate what kind of person we want to be in the world. In our class, we'll read the novel closely and debate how its essential questions can shape our personal choices moving forward."],["Class Materials (Required)","Cervantes, Miguel de. Don Quixote.

The course approaches this question by considering several key trends in Latin American literature in the second half of the twentieth century. Focusing on novels, short fiction, and testimonial writing & film, we will study representative works from the so-called pre-Boom, Boom, and post-Boom decades (1940s-50s, 1960s-70s, 1980s). Although the new narrative is often identified with Boom novels (such as One Hundred Years of Solitude) and with the Boom era overall—when Latin American literature \"exploded\" onto the world stage--we will take a broader view to consider the diverse types of narrative representing \"new\" currents in the region. Reading and discussion will focus on formal aspects of narrative and on cultural and historical contexts that shaped the production and reception of new narrative works by well-known figures. Primary texts: Borges's and Cortázar's \"fantastic\" fictions and essays on narrative poetics; Fuentes's revolutionary Boom novel about 20th-century Mexico (The Death of Artemio Cruz); Ferré's irreverent feminist stories about Puerto Rican society and culture; Valenzuela's ironic dramatic fictions about political repression in Argentina; García Márquez's documentary-testimonial tale about an exiled filmmaker's covert return home during the Pinochet era (Clandestine in Chile: The Adventures of Miguel Littin).

As such, throughout this course, students will:\n- Observe the forms, genres, and styles of literary and artistic expression in Latin America through practices of close reading and analysis.\n- Gain awareness of the social, political, cultural, and historical factors influencing artistic expression, the relations between the artist and the public, and the potential of creative art to challenge or to affirm social, cultural and literary norms through discussions of twentieth-century Latin American writers' challenge to conventional literary forms, themes, and styles.\n- Appreciate how literature and the arts reveal the differences and diversity, as well as the continuity and unity, of human cultures. Key topics in this category will include how the Latin American \"new\" narrative was produced and received globally as well as locally; how it interrogated literary canons and cultural hierarchies, offering \"new\" ways of reading; and how a diverse group of writers reshaped the image of the Latin American writer, as well as that of Latin American literature, around the world.\n- Produce acts of persuasive interpretation, analysis, and commentary on literature and art, both spoken and written through class participation and writing assignments.\n- By emulating the subtleties of literature and art, students develop their Spanish writing skills and sharpen their powers of interpretation, critique, and aesthetic perception through the summary, close reading, contextualization, and analysis of course materials in short writing assignments and a final paper. This course also satisfies the Global Overlay requirement.

We will study literature in historical context and vis-à-vis other media. The purpose is that the students improve their language and critical analysis skills, while familiarizing themselves with the most important aesthetic and political currents of the last centuries in Spain through literature. We will think in and out of the canon of Spanish literature with a critical approach. Issues such as the construction and deconstruction of authorship, the audience, literary genres, avant-garde experimentation and censorship will be discussed. Novels, poetry, and plays are analyzed with an emphasis on the impact of empire and post-empire, feminism, anti-racism, queerness, and plurilingualism.

At the core of our theoretical framework, we test Jorge Luis Borges' famous proposition that marginal cultures -minor literatures have legitimate access to a multiplicity of cultural traditions advocating an irreverent use of the universal archive as the source of true originality."],["Class Materials (Required)","All course materials will be available on Canvas."]]}]},{"i":"020957","c":"WCAS","t":"Dissertation Prospectus Writing Workshop","u":"SPANPORT","n":"496-0","s":[{"i":"020957-1","r":[{"n":"German Campos-Munoz"}],"t":"Dissertation Prospectus Writing Workshop","u":"SPANPORT","n":"496-0","s":"1","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge 3535 Span & Port Sem Rm"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15}]},{"i":"020806","c":"WCAS","t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":[{"i":"020806-20","r":[{"n":"Nathalie Bouzaglou","p":"847/467-1543","a":"3-139 Crowe"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"20","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-21","r":[{"n":"Cesar A Braga-Pinto"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"21","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-22","r":[{"n":"Francisco Miguel Caballero Vazquez"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"22","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-23","r":[{"n":"Jeffrey Kwesi Coleman"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"23","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-24","r":[{"n":"Lucille Kerr","p":"847/467-6698","a":"3-131 Crowe"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"24","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-25","r":[{"n":"Maria Alejandra Uslenghi","p":"847/467-1713","a":"3-113 Crowe"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"25","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-27","r":[{"n":"Alfonso Fierro Obregon"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"27","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-29","r":[{"n":"Maria Jesus Barros Garcia","p":"847/491-8278","a":"3-117 Crowe"}],"t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"29","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-30","t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"30","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-31","t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"31","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."},{"i":"020806-32","t":"Teaching Assistantship and Methodologies","u":"SPANPORT","n":"570-0","s":"32","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"IND","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students."}]},{"i":"024812","c":"WCAS","t":"College Seminar","u":"STAT","n":"101-7","s":[{"i":"024812-20","r":[{"n":"Sandy L Zabell","p":"8474915564","a":"Lunt 227"}],"t":"College Seminar","u":"STAT","n":"101-7","s":"20","m":["024"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 3622"],"d":"2023-09-19","e":"2023-12-02","c":"SEM","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","Topic: Cryptology Cryptology is the study of secret writing, or more generally secure communication.
